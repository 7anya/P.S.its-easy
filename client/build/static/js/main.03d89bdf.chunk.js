Before the electricity arrangement can expand by the degree required to deliver universal electricity access in a reliable and clean manner, there are several issues that need to be resolved. Foremost, the focus is on the areas of innovative, fast, precise and affordable monitoring and control of the system. This can give a huge boost to the viability of solar/renewable technology, & have strong positive effects on the drivers of their profitability \u2013 revenues, tariffs and costs. Strong monitoring capabilities also give confidence to investors and donors, along with enhancing the customer experience by improving the availability, reliability, and quality of supply and increasing convenience and information about usage. There are several issues like weather, shadowing, panel degradation, poor design, and usage of inferior material, which cause losses up to 50% of the production over the years. We are developing a low-cost, easy-to-install, high-tech monitoring solution that keeps users, owners, & service providers constantly up to date on the solar system\u2019s performance, and ensures rapid maintenance & a continuous return on the investment. SmartHelio will monitor the solar panels, batteries & loads, run machine learning models for predictive analysis and generate intelligent business insights. It will also act as a smart meter & report solar energy usage to the service provider, which will help them in invoicing and revenue collection from the end-users in case of 3rd party-owned systems.\\nSkills: For the hardware development\\n1.

The current NIMBUS quota management will not be sufficient to distribute NIMBUS resources fairly to teams. We need a service which keep track of the resources, and do the admission control as per the administrator\u2019s settings for a team or a particular user. Administrator can take decision as per the current VMC delivery priority and set quota to groups. \\nUsers will be restricted if they are going beyond quota setting, this will reduce the failures and keep system always healthy and reliable.\\nUsage Statistics:\\nUsage statistics will help administrator to keep track of team\u2019s usage and adjust resource allocation. This will help administrator to estimate of NIMBUS resources\\nIndividual users can get to know their current and past usage statistics to recommend administrator for quota adjustments. Estimates for deployment will make users more confident to get a SDDC deployed on the NIMBUS VMC platform.\\nDiagnostics\\nThis will be one stop interface to run diagnostics for a SDDC to know any anomalies. This will reduce the triaging time for any of subject matter experts. Diagnostics will be intelligent to run on any of the SDDC on VMC NIMBUS 2.o to give a initial glance of problems.\\nSharing\\nUsers can share SDDC for a specific build or configuration e.g MultiAZ with a build, a upgraded SDDC etc. System will search for alive SDDC with a specific configuration search criteria and can request the SDDC owner. Owner should able to share the SDDC in one click to a user. This will reduce the time for users in search of seeing a configuration or do a non-destructive operation.\\nHealth monitoring:\\nThis will give everyone a one stop interface which aggregates different source of health information of systems and give users a confidence. This will reduce the effort of administrator to reach out to users for any infrastructure issues, this will be a self-service. Administrator can even put alerts on the console for general purpose. Users can subscribe/un-subscribe for any specific alerts like usage statistics, current estimation etc periodically.  \\nRunbooks and How-to\\nGive a search with keywords to get a specific documents on a runbook or how-to. This will search a specific confluence namespace to get the pinpointed details.\\n\\n\u2022\\tIdentify domain area and various sub areas of the Project:\\nDomain \u2013 Cloud Platform\\no\\tSystem Virtualization\\no\\tSaaS Health monitoring\\no\\tAWS services\\no\\tSpringboot \\n\\nProject - 3\\n \\n(a)\\tProject description in terms of broad phases: \\nThe overall project is VMC i.e VMWare on AWS cloud.

Before the electricity arrangement can expand by the degree required to deliver universal electricity access in a reliable and clean manner, there are several issues that need to be resolved. Foremost, the focus is on the areas of innovative, fast, precise and affordable monitoring and control of the system. This can give a huge boost to the viability of solar/renewable technology, & have strong positive effects on the drivers of their profitability \u2013 revenues, tariffs and costs. Strong monitoring capabilities also give confidence to investors and donors, along with enhancing the customer experience by improving the availability, reliability, and quality of supply and increasing convenience and information about usage. There are several issues like weather, shadowing, panel degradation, poor design, and usage of inferior material, which cause losses up to 50% of the production over the years. We are developing a low-cost, easy-to-install, high-tech monitoring solution that keeps users, owners, & service providers constantly up to date on the solar system\u2019s performance, and ensures rapid maintenance & a continuous return on the investment. SmartHelio will monitor the solar panels, batteries & loads, run machine learning models for predictive analysis and generate intelligent business insights. It will also act as a smart meter & report solar energy usage to the service provider, which will help them in invoicing and revenue collection from the end-users in case of 3rd party-owned systems.\\nSkills: For the hardware development\\n1.

Before the electricity arrangement can expand by the degree required to deliver universal electricity access in a reliable and clean manner, there are several issues that need to be resolved. Foremost, the focus is on the areas of innovative, fast, precise and affordable monitoring and control of the system. This can give a huge boost to the viability of solar/renewable technology, & have strong positive effects on the drivers of their profitability \u2013 revenues, tariffs and costs. Strong monitoring capabilities also give confidence to investors and donors, along with enhancing the customer experience by improving the availability, reliability, and quality of supply and increasing convenience and information about usage. There are several issues like weather, shadowing, panel degradation, poor design, and usage of inferior material, which cause losses up to 50% of the production over the years. We are developing a low-cost, easy-to-install, high-tech monitoring solution that keeps users, owners, & service providers constantly up to date on the solar system\u2019s performance, and ensures rapid maintenance & a continuous return on the investment. SmartHelio will monitor the solar panels, batteries & loads, run machine learning models for predictive analysis and generate intelligent business insights. It will also act as a smart meter & report solar energy usage to the service provider, which will help them in invoicing and revenue collection from the end-users in case of 3rd party-owned systems.\\nSkills: For the hardware development\\n1.

Dissolution process is carried out at a controlled temperature for which temperature measurements are critical. The temperature is measured using thermocouples. Replacement of the thermocouple in the liquid phase is practically very difficult.

An optimum process condition is required to produce defect free casting of metal alloy rods. The thermal analysis of solidification of alloy in the casting process is vital as the metallurgical structure as well as mechanical properties of alloy rod is inherently associated with the solidification process. The casting process can be simulated using commercial softwares like ProCAST, SoftCAST or COMSOL multiphysics modelling software.  The casting process of rod from liquid to solid state is to be modelled using the flow multiphysics interface combining heat transfer and fluid flow. The results of the model allows for optimization of the process in terms of casting rate and cooling.\\nProject domain\\tMechanical Engineering\\nSkills:  CAD modeling software, Any FEM tool\\nThermodynamics, Heat & Mass transfer, Physical Metallurgy\\n\u2022\\tContinuous casting process\\n\u2022\\tThermal analysis of Solidification   \\n\u2022\\tMetallurgy of Uranium alloy \\n\\nSkills:  - \\nStudents Required: 1\\nMin CGPA: 0\\nMax CGPA: 0\\n\\nProject: 3\\nTitle: Experimental investigation and modeling of mass transfer performance of modified Taylor couette contactor\\nDescription: In nuclear fuel reprocessing solvent extraction operation occupies a central role in the recovery of fissile material from the spent nuclear fuel. Processing of radioactive material in solvent extraction operation imposes several challenges for the design of solvent extraction contactors. Some of the challenges during the development of solvent extraction contactors for radioactive applications are short residence time, critically safe design for handling high concentration of fissile material and maintenance free of operation. While considering the above limitation Taylor couette flow pattern offers several advantages such as low holdup, short residence time and critically safe design. But the throughput of taylor couette contactor is limited and several modifications were proposed to enhance the through put of the contactor and these contactors are generally called modified taylor couette contactors. In this project work mass transfer performance of the modified taylor couette contactors will be studied using the standard liquid-liquid test system. The mass transfer performance will be studied for various operating condition such as rotational speed, continuous and dispersed flow rates. The overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient will be estimated and suitable correlation to be developed. In addition to that non ideal mixing will be studied using axial dispersion model.\\nProject domain\\tMass transfer equipment design\\nSkills: Person should familiar with the basic chemical engineering principles and keen interest to perform experiments in prototype counter current solvent extraction contactors.\\nFamiliarity in MATLAB is preferred.

Nuclear heat generated in the reactor core due to fission is extracted using Liquid sodium as coolant. FBTR is loop type reactor, which has two primary loops to exchange the heat to secondary sodium system. Further heat in secondary sodium system is transferred to steam water system to generate electricity. The heat generated inside the core is distributed equally to two primary loops. Each loop has a heat exchanger and sodium pump.  After exchanging the heat to secondary sodium in the   heat exchangers in each loop sodium in both the loops is passed through a common inlet pipe into the reactor vessel.\\nOver flow tank collects the excess sodium in Reactor vessel, and through EM pump part of the sodium is passed through a sodium purification circuit. Sodium return to Reactor vessel after the purification. Over flow tank plays important role in the maintenance of sodium level in RV.\\nThe decrease in sodium level in OFT is one of the indirect indications of leak in primary sodium loop. Hence OFT sodium level discordance Alarm is provided in Main control room to alert the operator, in case of change in the level of OFT.  Presently the alarm setpoint is manually set by the operator in control station after OFT level stabilizes. However, OFT also changes during normal process. Since the capacities of primary loops are interconnected, with increase in sodium temperature, sodium volume also increases and hence the level in various capacities and hence, it reflects an increase in sodium level in OFT. So, the operator has to frequently change or set the discordance alarm threshold during genuine process changes. Due to which it may happen that alarm due to actual leak may get masked during process transients.\\nHence, it is required to have automatic setpoint tracker to ensure that setpoint is automatically \u201c tracked\u201d following the OFT level in case of genuine process changes. \\nThe project is to design and develop an automatic setpoint tracker, which includes signal conditioning of temperature signal, analyzing of data (sodium level vs temperature) and deriving relationship between the changes in OFT sodium level and changes in temperature and suitably changing the setpoint. \\n\\nSkills:  - \\nStudents Required: 1\\nMin CGPA: 0\\nMax CGPA: 0\\n\\nProject: 6\\nTitle: Signal and image processing for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) applications\\nDescription: The project involves processing of ultrasonic phased array signals obtained by advanced data acquisition approaches to visualize misoriented defects in a component.

Dissolution process is carried out at a controlled temperature for which temperature measurements are critical. The temperature is measured using thermocouples. Replacement of the thermocouple in the liquid phase is practically very difficult. The development of a \u2018soft sensor\u2019 for this application will be highly beneficial for the Plant.\\n\\nSoft sensors are computer based systems based on mathematical models to estimate process variables. They are useful for sensor validation, fault detection, customized sensing etc.\\n\\nKalman filtering is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone.\\n\\nA soft sensor will be developed for determining the liquid temperature of the dissolver of the Plant based on the live data from other sensors for dissolver vapour temperature, level, density and pressure. The sensor model will be developed using Matlab tools for Kalman Filter. The soft sensor will be qualified for various performance parameters relevant for control and safety. The soft sensor developed using Kalman Filter will be compared to that developed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method. Finally, the Kalman Filter based algorithm will be implemented in Raspberry Pi hardware with GUI developed on Python language. \\nProject domain\\tInstrumentation, Electronics and Computers\\nSkills: Person should familiar with the basic principles of Electronic instrumentation and with keen interest in software applications.\\nFamiliarity in MATLAB is preferred.

An optimum process condition is required to produce defect free casting of metal alloy rods. The thermal analysis of solidification of alloy in the casting process is vital as the metallurgical structure as well as mechanical properties of alloy rod is inherently associated with the solidification process. The casting process can be simulated using commercial softwares like ProCAST, SoftCAST or COMSOL multiphysics modelling software.  The casting process of rod from liquid to solid state is to be modelled using the flow multiphysics interface combining heat transfer and fluid flow. The results of the model allows for optimization of the process in terms of casting rate and cooling.\\nProject domain\\tMechanical Engineering\\nSkills:  CAD modeling software, Any FEM tool\\nThermodynamics, Heat & Mass transfer, Physical Metallurgy\\n\u2022\\tContinuous casting process\\n\u2022\\tThermal analysis of Solidification   \\n\u2022\\tMetallurgy of Uranium alloy \\n\\nSkills:  - \\nStudents Required: 1\\nMin CGPA: 0\\nMax CGPA: 0\\n\\nProject: 3\\nTitle: Experimental investigation and modeling of mass transfer performance of modified Taylor couette contactor\\nDescription: In nuclear fuel reprocessing solvent extraction operation occupies a central role in the recovery of fissile material from the spent nuclear fuel. Processing of radioactive material in solvent extraction operation imposes several challenges for the design of solvent extraction contactors. Some of the challenges during the development of solvent extraction contactors for radioactive applications are short residence time, critically safe design for handling high concentration of fissile material and maintenance free of operation. While considering the above limitation Taylor couette flow pattern offers several advantages such as low holdup, short residence time and critically safe design. But the throughput of taylor couette contactor is limited and several modifications were proposed to enhance the through put of the contactor and these contactors are generally called modified taylor couette contactors. In this project work mass transfer performance of the modified taylor couette contactors will be studied using the standard liquid-liquid test system. The mass transfer performance will be studied for various operating condition such as rotational speed, continuous and dispersed flow rates.

Nuclear heat generated in the reactor core due to fission is extracted using Liquid sodium as coolant. FBTR is loop type reactor, which has two primary loops to exchange the heat to secondary sodium system. Further heat in secondary sodium system is transferred to steam water system to generate electricity. The heat generated inside the core is distributed equally to two primary loops. Each loop has a heat exchanger and sodium pump.  After exchanging the heat to secondary sodium in the   heat exchangers in each loop sodium in both the loops is passed through a common inlet pipe into the reactor vessel.\\nOver flow tank collects the excess sodium in Reactor vessel, and through EM pump part of the sodium is passed through a sodium purification circuit. Sodium return to Reactor vessel after the purification. Over flow tank plays important role in the maintenance of sodium level in RV.\\nThe decrease in sodium level in OFT is one of the indirect indications of leak in primary sodium loop. Hence OFT sodium level discordance Alarm is provided in Main control room to alert the operator, in case of change in the level of OFT.  Presently the alarm setpoint is manually set by the operator in control station after OFT level stabilizes. However, OFT also changes during normal process. Since the capacities of primary loops are interconnected, with increase in sodium temperature, sodium volume also increases and hence the level in various capacities and hence, it reflects an increase in sodium level in OFT. So, the operator has to frequently change or set the discordance alarm threshold during genuine process changes. Due to which it may happen that alarm due to actual leak may get masked during process transients.\\nHence, it is required to have automatic setpoint tracker to ensure that setpoint is automatically \u201c tracked\u201d following the OFT level in case of genuine process changes. \\nThe project is to design and develop an automatic setpoint tracker, which includes signal conditioning of temperature signal, analyzing of data (sodium level vs temperature) and deriving relationship between the changes in OFT sodium level and changes in temperature and suitably changing the setpoint. \\n\\nSkills:  - \\nStudents Required: 1\\nMin CGPA: 0\\nMax CGPA: 0\\n\\nProject: 6\\nTitle: Signal and image processing for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) applications\\nDescription: The project involves processing of ultrasonic phased array signals obtained by advanced data acquisition approaches to visualize misoriented defects in a component.

The current NIMBUS quota management will not be sufficient to distribute NIMBUS resources fairly to teams. We need a service which keep track of the resources, and do the admission control as per the administrator\u2019s settings for a team or a particular user. Administrator can take decision as per the current VMC delivery priority and set quota to groups. \\nUsers will be restricted if they are going beyond quota setting, this will reduce the failures and keep system always healthy and reliable.\\nUsage Statistics:\\nUsage statistics will help administrator to keep track of team\u2019s usage and adjust resource allocation. This will help administrator to estimate of NIMBUS resources\\nIndividual users can get to know their current and past usage statistics to recommend administrator for quota adjustments. Estimates for deployment will make users more confident to get a SDDC deployed on the NIMBUS VMC platform.\\nDiagnostics\\nThis will be one stop interface to run diagnostics for a SDDC to know any anomalies. This will reduce the triaging time for any of subject matter experts. Diagnostics will be intelligent to run on any of the SDDC on VMC NIMBUS 2.o to give a initial glance of problems.\\nSharing\\nUsers can share SDDC for a specific build or configuration e.g MultiAZ with a build, a upgraded SDDC etc. System will search for alive SDDC with a specific configuration search criteria and can request the SDDC owner. Owner should able to share the SDDC in one click to a user. This will reduce the time for users in search of seeing a configuration or do a non-destructive operation.\\nHealth monitoring:\\nThis will give everyone a one stop interface which aggregates different source of health information of systems and give users a confidence. This will reduce the effort of administrator to reach out to users for any infrastructure issues, this will be a self-service. Administrator can even put alerts on the console for general purpose. Users can subscribe/un-subscribe for any specific alerts like usage statistics, current estimation etc periodically.  \\nRunbooks and How-to\\nGive a search with keywords to get a specific documents on a runbook or how-to. This will search a specific confluence namespace to get the pinpointed details.\\n\\n\u2022\\tIdentify domain area and various sub areas of the Project:\\nDomain \u2013 Cloud Platform\\no\\tSystem Virtualization\\no\\tSaaS Health monitoring\\no\\tAWS services\\no\\tSpringboot \\n\\nProject - 3\\n \\n(a)\\tProject description in terms of broad phases: \\nThe overall project is VMC i.e VMWare on AWS cloud.

In fact, all marketers should make it a goal to learn how to analyze, interpret, and communicate data. We expect the intern to be able to do some deep data research and analysis to come up with new products, services, and newer ways to revenue for the current and prospective customers of Wavelabs. In our world, that data could come from Facebook Insights, LinkedIn Analytics, HubSpot Sources, Google Analytics, or anything else.\\n2.\\tOver the period of 6 months, the intern is expected to design, and execute a marketing campaign independently. He or she could first create a landing page that can be promoted through our LinkedIn page, and then write a blog post to promote the offer on that landing page. Their next step would be to coordinate with team to manage email and social media marketing to plan additional promotion. The intern is expected to track and collect the results from this project and document it in his or her portfolio.\\n3.\\tThe intern will also need to create a full, ready-to-publish piece of content (e-book, or whitepaper). The intern should research, write, add images, design layout, and make the entire ebook publish-worthy. By managing each piece of the process, the intern will understand all the steps necessary to create the content and feel true ownership of what he or she made!\\n4.\\tPresentation skills are crucial in the working world, and every intern should have an opportunity to practice in front of an audience. At the end of their project, the intern is expected to create a presentation from scratch on either something they learned at the company or something interesting that could help the marketing team. Did he/she learn how to use a new tool? Did they uncover some interesting takeaways from the research project they tackled? The intern would be expected to teach everyone else what they discovered.\\nProject domain\\tMarketing\\n1.\\tAbility to conduct deep market research.\\n2.\\tAbility to write/design/present a piece of content\\n3.\\tProof somebody\u2019s work and be able to give valuable feedback\\nMBA  preferred but anyone keen to pursue career in Management is also fine.\\n\\n1.\\tThe intern would learn to tackle difficult, independent marketing projects\\n2.\\tThe intern would understand the inner workings of an IT service company, giving them the opportunity to learn about how business works as a whole and explore all the cogs that go into the machine\\n3.\\tThe intern would be given the opportunity to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them.

He or she could first create a landing page that can be promoted through our LinkedIn page, and then write a blog post to promote the offer on that landing page.

The intern is expected to track and collect the results from this project and document it in his or her portfolio.\\n3.\\tThe intern will also need to create a full, ready-to-publish piece of content (e-book, or whitepaper). The intern should research, write, add images, design layout, and make the entire ebook publish-worthy. By managing each piece of the process, the intern will understand all the steps necessary to create the content and feel true ownership of what he or she made!\\n4.\\tPresentation skills are crucial in the working world, and every intern should have an opportunity to practice in front of an audience. At the end of their project, the intern is expected to create a presentation from scratch on either something they learned at the company or something interesting that could help the marketing team.

In fact, all marketers should make it a goal to learn how to analyze, interpret, and communicate data. We expect the intern to be able to do some deep data research and analysis to come up with new products, services, and newer ways to revenue for the current and prospective customers of Wavelabs. In our world, that data could come from Facebook Insights, LinkedIn Analytics, HubSpot Sources, Google Analytics, or anything else.\\n2.\\tOver the period of 6 months, the intern is expected to design, and execute a marketing campaign independently. He or she could first create a landing page that can be promoted through our LinkedIn page, and then write a blog post to promote the offer on that landing page. Their next step would be to coordinate with team to manage email and social media marketing to plan additional promotion. The intern is expected to track and collect the results from this project and document it in his or her portfolio.\\n3.\\tThe intern will also need to create a full, ready-to-publish piece of content (e-book, or whitepaper). The intern should research, write, add images, design layout, and make the entire ebook publish-worthy. By managing each piece of the process, the intern will understand all the steps necessary to create the content and feel true ownership of what he or she made!\\n4.\\tPresentation skills are crucial in the working world, and every intern should have an opportunity to practice in front of an audience. At the end of their project, the intern is expected to create a presentation from scratch on either something they learned at the company or something interesting that could help the marketing team. Did he/she learn how to use a new tool? Did they uncover some interesting takeaways from the research project they tackled? The intern would be expected to teach everyone else what they discovered.\\nProject domain\\tMarketing\\n1.\\tAbility to conduct deep market research.\\n2.\\tAbility to write/design/present a piece of content\\n3.\\tProof somebody\u2019s work and be able to give valuable feedback\\nMBA  preferred but anyone keen to pursue career in Management is also fine.\\n\\n1.\\tThe intern would learn to tackle difficult, independent marketing projects\\n2.\\tThe intern would understand the inner workings of an IT service company, giving them the opportunity to learn about how business works as a whole and explore all the cogs that go into the machine\\n3.\\tThe intern would be given the opportunity to take risks, make mistakes, and learn from them.
