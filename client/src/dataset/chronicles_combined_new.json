Process behavior in the \naluminum smelting  industry  is  typically  highly  dynamic  and  unstable  and  involves  non-linear,  highly \ndimensional  relationships  among  process  parameters.  Therefore,  a  control  algorithm  is  required  to \nstabilize the performance of the reduction cell. Therein lies the importance of avoiding or reducing the \nharmful effects by taking appropriate actions early enough, in the view of various time lags such as the \ndelay caused by the time required to dissolve the alumina into the bath. Time series predictive modeling \nis  the  one  of  the  method  to  control  the  anode  effects.  We  can  maintain  the  required  alumina \npercentage in the bath.

It  provides  monitoring  and  management  of  cloud  application.  Autodesk's  Fusion360  Team \nproduct  has  basic  NewRelic  integration  helping  to  do  health  monitoring.  My  project  was  aimed  to \ncapture  more  functional  and  non-functional analytical  data  and  publish  to NewRelic,  as  new  metrics. \nThese  metrics  can  help  in  bringing  in-depth  visibility  of  the  product's  health,  user  behavior,  detect \nanomalies  and perform real-time diagnostics.

It is primarily responsible for the strength and tenacity of the\nyarn by retarding the rate of regeneration of cellulose while spinning. Zinc is very poisonous but\nit is significant in the process of Rayon Production, hence it cannot be eliminated from the\nprocess. Thus, it also makes its way into the wastes of the rayon industry. Due to the poisonous\nof Zinc even in small quantities, Government norms prevent its release into the environment at\nconcentrations higher than 5ppm and is removed at the ETP in the form of sludge. Zinc is a\nconsiderably costly metal.

				"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II: The canonical Wg signaling pathway is an important topic of \nresearch  in  cell  signaling  and  developmental  biology.  The  Wg  ligand  in  Drosophila  interacts  with  its \nsignaling  receptors  Frizzled  and  co-receptor  Arrow  and  binding  receptor  Dally  and  Dlp  resulting  in  an \nactivated  signaling  response.  The  key  player  in  this  signal  transduction  is  the  transcriptional  activator \nbeta-catenin  (Armadillo  in  Drosophila)  whose  cytoplasmic levels  increase  when  Wingless  signaling  is \nactive. For this purpose, we cultured S2 pTub Wg cells expressing Wg ligand, to obtain Wg conditioned \nmedia  which  will  then  be  purified.  We  made  efforts  to  develope  constructs  expressing  Wg  GFP,  Wg \nSNAP  and Dfz2 GFP to visualize  the said proteins under the microscope  and to measure  the respective \nconcentrations.    Immunostaining  and  Western    blot    assays    were    performed    to    understand  the \nArmadillo  protein  accumulation  in  S2R+cells  exposed    to  different  conditions  resulting    in    signaling  \nactivation, as well to check for the presence of Wg upon subjection to various steps for purification. The \nexpectation was to propose a model explaining the change in signaling readout observed on treatment \nof S2R+  cells with different quantities of ligand as well receptor expressed with respect to time. \nTools used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): I  used  tools  like  SnapGene  to  design  plasmids,  Western \nBlots to understand signaling, microscopy for visualization of fluorophores, Imagej for image analysis. \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  main  objectives  were  1) purifications  of  Wg  protein  2) expression  of \ntagged  ligand  and  receptor  3)  understanding  the  role  of  endocytosis  over  plasma  membrane  in  Wg \nsignaling  pathway  4) propose  a  model  for  understanding  the  change  in  signaling  with  change  in \nconcentration of ligand and receptor \nOutcomes of the project: 1) I was able to standardize the protocol for Wg protein purification \n2) Design an improved way to isolate Wg protein \n3) Development of the Wg GFP expressing construct. \n\nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: This  project  was  extremely  useful  in    practical  application  of  classroom \nknowledge. I was also able to learn how to design and trouble shoot experiments. Bangalore Microscopy \nCourse gave me the opportunity to explore the field of microscopy superficially. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Mayor  Lab  is  provides  a \ngreat learning opportunity for those interested in understanding cell signaling and microscopy.

It  receives  sensory  inputs  and  motor  commands,  and  act  as  an  integrator  to  fine  tune \nmotor  pattern.  Zebrafish  serves  as  an  excellent  model  organism  to  understand  the  cerebellar  circuitry \nand  its  functioning,  primarily  due  to  its  easy  accessibility  and  conserved cerebellar  layered  structure \nfrom  fish  to  mammals.  Purkinje  neurons  in  the  cerebellum  play  a  key  role  in  modulating  the  outputs \nfrom the cerebellum. They exhibit bistabilty in vivo and in vitro. Presence of two stable  states has also \nbeen  identified  in  the  zebrafish.  They  form  their  inhibitory  synapses  on  eurydendroid  cells,  which \nconstitute  the  major output  of  the  zebrafish  cerebellum.  How  the  activity  pattern  of  the  eurydendroid \ncells  is  affected  due  to  the  presence  of  Purkinje  neurons  in  either  states  is  not  known.  Many  Purkinje \nneurons converge on single eurydendroid cell, making it difficult to study the eurydendroid cell response \ndue    to    single    Purkinje    activity    through    direct    electrophysiology.    To    overcome    this,    CA8-\ncfos:ChR2(H134R)-mcherry plasmid was constructed to optogenetically activate a population of Purkinje \nneurons.  CA8,  a  Purkinje  neuron  specific  promoter  along  with  cfos  enhancer  element  was  cloned \nupstream  of  channelrhodopsin  protein.  Channelrhodopsin  is  a  mixed  cation  permeable  channel  which \ngets activated on stimulation of light. This protein was fused with mcherry fluorescent tag. The plasmid \nexpression was verified in the Purkinje neurons of the zebrafish. This constructed plasmid will facilitate \n\nstudying the effect of Purkinje neuronal states on eurydendroid cells by employing electrophysiological \ntechniques   and   optogenetics,   and   thereby   assist   in   understanding   how   the   Purkinje   and   the \neurydendroid cells together shape the output of the cerebellum. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Electrophysiology \nMicroinjection \nOptogentics \nObjectives of the project: Construction of CA8:ChR2-mcherry plamid. Microinject constructed plasmid in \nzebrafish  larvae.   Screen  microinjected  zebrafish  for  mcherry  expression. Grow  transgenic  line  of \nzebrafish with CA8:ChR2-mcherry germline expression. Select light source for activation of ChR2 in 7dpf \nzebrafish \nOutcomes of the project: Successful construction of CA8:ChR2-mcherry \nMajor   Learning   Outcomes: Learned   techniques   of   zebrafish   dissection,   microinjection,   cloning, \nelectrophysiology \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Individuals get assigned to \nan ongoing project in the lab.

Also, whether the host plant affected \nthe life cycle of the herbivore and the defence level. \nOutcomes of the project: It was observed that host plant affects the life cycle of the herbivore in terms \nof oviposition and larval fitness. Also, the % parasitization of the herbivore by the parasitoid is affected \nby the host plant on which it is reared. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: It  can  be  concluded  that  host  plant  affects  the  interaction  between  the \nherbivore  and  the  parasitoid.

Initially I have given some \nppts so that I can go through them and understand how everything works in maintenance department. \nMy project consists of three different phases, each one of them further divided into small steps and the \noutcome  of  the  project  is  to  improve  the  key  performance  indicators  of  all  A  class  machines  and  pilot \nchannel. I worked as a bridge between the project and my mentor and helped him in each phase and in \neach step in the best possible way. I used to collect all the data for KPI's  month wise from the software \nused by maintenance department and analyze it. In the end we calculated the overall improvement in all \nsix  month  and  tried  to  analyze  it.  During  my  internship  I  got  certification  for  lean  six  sigma  white  belt. \nApart  from  the  project  i  have  done  small  projects  on  various  channels  and  under  different  mentors \nwhich  proved  to  be  a very  good  learning  experience. we  used  to  take  trials  of  125  or  150  bearings  on \ndifferent  channels  to  find out  the  capability  of  machines. we  worked  on  a  Ovality  project  aimed  to \nreduce  down  the  ovality  as  required  by  the  customers  so  we  took  200  readings  after  heat  treatment, \nrough grinding and finish grinding to find out which process causes the ovality problem. For auto pairing \n\nmachine we wanted to figure out the effect of different parameters on friction torque so three different \ntimes we took 125 readings of standout for both cup and cone and tried to develop a relation between \nfriction torque and other parameters. Under Mohan Pandit sir we performed zero lost study on one of \nthe  channels  and  calculated  First  Time  Yield  (FYI)  and  Roll Time  yield  (RTY). In  the  end  I presented  my \nproject to company and my PS faculty and got the certification. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): CMMS, FTM, Minitab, MS Word \nObjectives  of  the  project: 30%  improvement  in KPI's of  all  A  class macj=hines  and  pilot  channel.  spare \nparts optimization. Maintenance cost reduction. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: After  the  implementation  of  the  second  phase  of  SPS  we  have  got  desired \nresults  but  still there  are  some  fluctuation  in  some  of  the  machines'  KPI  which will  be  reduce  down to \nachieve the target result with the help of third phase which is a continuous improvement phase. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: There is a lot to learn in this organization. During my project I learnt how to \nhandle data and how to analyze it. I learnt the software CMMS and FTM which is used by maintenance \ndepartment to extract data. \nDuring process capability analyses we got familiar to Minitab. \nGained a basic knowledge of lean six sigma and got white belt. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: T This  company  carries  a \nvery big brand name and working environment also matches that level. \nThe conversation gap between different department in this company doesn™t exist here. \nThe best thing which I like about the working culture in this organization is that you are not restricted to \nonly  your  project  mentor, anybody  can  ask  you  for  help  and  there  comes  the  chance  to  enhance  your \nlearning \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: This  project  related  to  the  professional  work  of  the  host \norigination so mostly it is irrelevant to the academic courses. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

However,  this  is  a  very  difficult \nprocess  since  the  building  undergoes  a  lot  of  changes  in  it's  response  because  of  environmental  and \noperational variations. Our project hence was to devise and test new methods for detecting damage in \nbuildings  from  acceleration  response  on  MATLAB.  The  devised  methods  were  even tested  for  a  few \nbenchmarks,  these  also  showed  good  results.  To  facilitate  the  process  of  damage  detection,  it  is \nuneconomical  and  inaccurate  to  use  sensors  all  over  the  building  and  hence  the  process  of  sub-\nstructuring  was  done  so  that  the  sensing  can  be just  confined  to  one  region  and  the  damage  in  the \nbuilding can be detected using limited sensors. Using substructuring and concepts like Gaussian Process, \nRandom Forests, Locally Linear Embedding and Symbolic Data series different methods were devised. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): MATLAB 2016b \n\nObjectives  of  the  project: To  innovate  new  methods  to  detect  and  localize  damage  in  buildings  and \nbridges in presence of environmental and operational variations \nOutcomes of the project: Analytical methods to detect damages in beams buildings and bridges \nMajor Learning Outcomes: Other than strengthening concepts in structural dynamics and finite element \nmethods, Learned basics of Machine Learning and Signal Processing \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: SERC  being  a  research \nfacility  has  many  divisions  which  have  divided  according  to  area  of  concentration.

				"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort  Summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: The  field  of  Structural  Health  Monitoring,  in  structural \nengineering  field,  is  gaining  strong attention  for  evaluating  damage  and  maintaining  the  structural \nintegrity of the civil engineering structures over its service life against the natural hazards such as strong \nwinds  and  earthquakes  of  high  magnitude.  The  cracks  which  are  initially  invisible to  eyes  can  be \ndisastrous leading to catastrophic failure of the whole structure. This can place the lives of many people \nat risk.  The continuous monitoring of structures is required to detect the damage in the structure at an \nearly  stage.  In  the  project, a  novel  approach  was  developed  for  the  damage  identification  and \nlocalization  for  a  beam  and  a  shear  building  by  employing  the  process  of  substructuring  using  auto \nregressive  models,  frequency  response  functions  and  finally  localized  damage  location  is  indicated  the \nform  of  Damage  Index.  This  project  also  covered  the  use  of  robust  regression  methods  to  account  for \nthe  uncertainties  (Environmental  variability,  noise,  and  temperature)  in  the  data  acquired  for  the \ndamage  identification  of  a  structure.  This  project  also  dealt  with  the  damage  localization  in  a  beam \nbased on the spectral diffusion mapping and fractal dimension. The fractal dimension developed for the \n\nbeam  also  employed  to  find  the  damage  location  in  the  plate  structure. The  developed  methods  are \ndata  driven  as  it  does  not  require  to  know  the  initial  stage  of  the  structure.  The  robust  methods  can \ndetect damage precisely. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): MATLAB  \nObjectives of the project: Development of robust methods for damage identification and localization of \ndamage in the structure \nOutcomes  of  the  project: The  robust  methods  to  detect  damage  in  the  beam  and  the  plate  structure \nwere  developed.  The  novel  approach  can  detect  the  damage  very  precisely.  Moreover,  the  new \ntechniques are able to identify damage in the structure even with a signal to noise ration of 30. This aids \nto  overcome  the  continuous  change  in  the  working  and  environment  condition  in  vicinity  of  the \nstructure. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: The project was multi-disciplinary, a person needs to have sound knowledge \nof structural analysis as well as mathematics. Through the project, I learned to use the Machine learning \nfor damage identification.

The environment of Structural Engineering \nResearch  Centre,  is  perfectly  what  a  researcher  requires.  I  worked  in  the  Structural  Health  Monitoring \nLaboratory,  the  laboratory  is equipped  with  high-speed  processing  computers  which  are  essential  for \ncomputational simulations. The people in the lab were very interactive which results in new and creative \nideas.  The  regular  interaction  with  scientist  always  intrigued  me  to  go  one  step ahead  to  get  the  best \noutcomes.  There  were  times  when  I  just  reached  the  dead-end  in  the  project  not  seeing  any  progress \nbut a discussion with the scientist and the Ph.D. students in the laboratory always helped to think a new \nway out to solve the problem. The Scientists of Structural Engineering Research Center currently having \na lot  of ideas and projects, a student can work  on these projects. This not only helps a student to gain \nknowledge but also develops a culture of research. Working at SERC, I found a new zeal to work in the \narea of Research and Development. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Introduction to Finite Element Methods, Numerical Analysis, \nStructural Dynamics, Probability and Statistics, Analysis of Structures, Computer Programming \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

In  short  it  is  about  collecting  information  from  the  shop  floor,  understanding \nthe working and compiling it. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Microsoft  Excel,  Part  numbers  and  Vehicle  combination \nnumber lists for different models of trucks. \nObjectives of the project: To make process sheets and process flow diagrams of load body mounting for \na range of truck models. \nOutcomes of the project: Process sheets and PFDs are complete for about 8 truck models. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Working  of  Hydraulics  in  tipper  bodies,  Assembly  of  the  load  body  on  the \nframe and knowledge about several parts used in the entire process. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Well  the  difficult  part  is \ngoing to the shop floor and collecting data as it takes around 4-5 hrs for a single vehicle to go through all \nthose  station  processes.  The  rest  of  time,  you  have  to  spend  on  compiling  the  data  and  working  on \nsheets mainly so it's the easy part.Getting to know about the assembly process and working of different \nparts is fun but the overall work is boring and they should have given some project where we could use \nour skills instead of excel sheet work. It's a typical industry job and well they make us work on Sundays \nwhen required. We do get holidays on some other day compensating for the Sunday but still sometimes \nit goes on for 2 weeks at a stretch without offs. There are hardly 10 official holidays in a year and every \nother holiday even for festivals like  Diwali and durga pooja, will be compensated for on Sundays. That is \nreally frustrating. Everything else is fine. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Automotive vehicles \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

Making the current layout of the area on \nAutoCAD and proposing new ones to reduce the current commotion and man-\nmaterial movements, and hence removing the bottlenecks. \nI worked on my 2nd major project of Kitting Store Shifting. So there was a lot of cross \nmovement when it came to Trim Line 2 and 3. The whole objective was to relocate \nthe stores (zone wise) and pull the sub-assemblies to the area between the 2 lines so \nas to improve supervision and communication with the production team. A lot of data \ncollection was involved in this project, post which the new layouts were proposed and \nthe implementation of the same took place during the Diwali holidays. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : AutoCAD , MS-Excel \n \nObjectives of the project  :  Propose a new Kitting Store layout for Trim Line 2 \nand 3 area. The project had multiple objectives; firstly to reduce the distance moved \nby kitting trolleys from the Kitting Stores to the feeding station, secondly to segregate \nthe sub-assemblies from the Kitting Stores and relocating them at an appropriate \nplace and thirdly to ensure that only moving parts are being stored in the Kitting \nStore. At present the Kitting Center besides line 2 caters to cabs of both Trim Line 2 \nand Trim Line 3 whereas Kitting Center beside Trim Line 3 caters to cowls of Trim \nLine 2. There’s a lot of unnecessary movement of man and materials in this case. \nThe objective was to shift the contents of the kitting centers in a planned and phased \nmanner.  \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : The learning outcomes were immense, specifically \nhow organisations of such large a stature work at the ground level, the inter-\ndepartmental dependence involved in its working. Coming to the project, I learnt to \nlearn about Logistics management - how it is the most important pillar of a \nmanufacturing industry. Being in the Planning Department, I had to communicate to a \nlot of people from other departments which even helped me to up the confidence in \nme which was lacking before. \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the \ncompany  : The working environment is quite conducive.

				"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort  Summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: Measure  of  Performance  is  essentially  a  Metric  which  is \nindicative  of  the  Adeptness  and  Efficiency  of  an  Automotive  Assembly  Line  and  is  based  on  the  MOST \nStudy. The Undertaken Investigation comprehensively establishes the Current  Status of the H LCV Post \nChassis  Lineâs  Functioning  and  its  existent  MOP  and  deliberates  exhaustively  on  the  possibilities  of \nOptimizing the MOP of the Line by systematic brainstorming, Empirical Analysis and Understanding the \n\nvery  crux  of  its  inception,  The  MOST  Technique.  Eventually,  it  labels  Man-Man  Mapping  as  the  most \nviable  recourse  after  having  taken  stock  of  and  putting  into  practice  equally  gripping  resolutions  to \nconsiderably  enhance  the MOP of  the  Line.  Thus,  promising  to  Bolster  the  Efficiency  of  the Entire  Post \nChassis LCV Assembly Line and possibly H LCV™s Overall Performance and standing. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): MOST software \nObjectives  of  the  project: An  Organization™s Robustness is contigent upon the host of divisions that \ncoalesce  seamlessly  to  attain  a  coterial  framework.  To  be  circumspect,  Simply  the  Output  or  the  sales \ngarnered might not be indicative of a firm™s footing and is definitely not a credible metric.  More  so, \nsuch  an  analysis  would  act  as  an  impediment  often  masquerading  gaping  quandaries  which  are  to  be \naddressed at dispatch. If there were to be such a Performance Metric in the first place, it must have to \nrespect the extensive Activities pursued by the firm often which cannot be analyzed under a single roof \nso to speak and has to be compartmentalized. Not withstanding, the said metric must be ideated in such \na  manner  that  it  could  ably  compare  disparate  Workstations  and  could  be  also  assimilated  in  order  to \ngather the performance of the firm on the whole. An existent metric which perfectly fits the Description \nis  Measure  of  Performance.  What  we  strive  to  achieve  is  pretty  much  simple,  TATA  already  gives  a \nleeway  of  about  240  Minutes.  So,  we  are left with 300 Minutes and even that™s pretty idealistic. 230 \ncuts out a favourable figure in the BES Grapevine and we somehow have to achieve the lofty target from \nthe existent 170. Or If Not, At least upwards of 200 which in itself seems pretty daunting.   \nOutcomes of the project: Thus the continuous efforts put on the line had finally been transformed into \nsomething which could quantify now. We had developed an action plan by scrutinizing each activity, its \nwork  content,  cycle  time,  the  operators  required and  developed  an  action  plan  considering  all  the \npractical considerations which led to a much appreciable utilization of each underutilized Operator and \nthus increasing the overall utilization as well. Yes, there were some processes like Load Body placement \nwhich had an unusually low 8% utilization but then we had already talked with BES regarding such things \nwhich  had  safety  considerations  to  be  inculcated  thus  leading  to  an  increase in  a  person  employed \nthere. These hiccups taught  to us to focus on the bigger picture of improving the  MOP by man to man \nmapping  rather  than  looking  to  satisfy  the  individual  demands  of  the  manufacturing  department  by \nincreasing the process activity time(which were having almost insignificant effect on MOP)  and the BES \ndepartment (whose guidelines were very impractical to follow).  The man to man mapping thus paved us \nthe way to increase the area wise and the overall MOP by analyzing the underutilized workforce at each \nstation  by  combining  two  or  more  of  such  processes  considering  the  feasibility,  tact  time,  workstation \n\ndifference  among a few. Getting acquainted with these  processes by spending considerable amount  of \ntime helped  us  in  our  endeavour. Also  some  of  the  processes  had  not  been  included  in  the  BES  line \nbalancing  data and  inclusion  of  these  processes  also  boosted  the  MOP.  Do  It  First  Time  Right  (DIFTR) \nInspection, which included post and pre inspection processes had not been considered and its inclusion \nincreased  the  work  content  of  such  fitment  processes  having  a  direct  impact  on  the  utilization \npercentage  and  the  MOP  of  each  area. This  project  gave  us  insights  into  developing  a  few  non-\nengineering  skills  such  as  mainly  negotiation,  which  are  highly  demanded  in  a  manufacturing  work \nposition. Although we  had some stalemate like  positions in the middle we  used the correct moves  and \nwere able to deliver a considerable increase in the MOP from around 180 to 260. Although our Proposed \nAction  Plans  shall  bear  fruit  in  the  imminent  future  we  have  nurtured  a  Framework  wherein  the \nMeasure  of  Performance  Metric  is  given  commensurate  attention  to  that  of  Achieving  the  Output,  we \nanticipate that the Management will take it up on themselves to foster their efficient functioning and be \nfrequently  in touch with the  Business  Excellence Services  and shed their animosity and doubts  as both \nthem are indeed working for a common cause that is to boost the Company™s LCV Footprint and \nundertake the most robust of Process Design and Techniques with quixotic efficiency.   \nMajor Learning Outcomes: MOST Analysis, Negotiation skills, Assembly line working \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Tata  Motors  Limited \n(Founded in 1945) is an Indigenous Multinational Automotive Manufacturing Firm based in the Financial \nCapital  of  India,  Mumbai  and  is  a  member  of  India™s  most  Influential  brand  the  Larger  TATA \nConglomerate.    A  USD  42  Billion  Organization,  it  is  a  leading  global  Automotive  Manufacturer  (17th \nOverall & 5th Largest in CV™s in the world) with a portfolio boasting of a plethora of range of Passenger \nCars, Sports  Vehicles, Commercial Buses and Trucks and State of the Art Defence  Vehicles. It is the De-\nfacto  leader  of  the  Indian  Automotive  Industry  and  is  the  5th  Largest  when  it  comes  to  the  Domestic \nPassenger  Vehicles sales. It™s On and OffRoad Footprint encompasses as much as over 175  Countries \nacross the Globe. Tata Motors Pimpri, Pune the flagship plant of TATA Motors is compartmentalized to \nallude to the production of Passenger (PVBU) and Commercial Vehicles (CVBU) separately. It espouses of \nall the facilities that TATA Motors could possibly muster up namely the Design, Manufacturing and the \nResearch and Development Centres. All of which are carried out concurrently.  With Over 60,000 strong \nEmployee base the Organizations brags of having sold upwards of 9 Million Vehicles and is credited with \nhaving upto 6,600 Sales and Service Points. The Pune Unit is one amongst the 20 locations in the world \nand   6   locations   in   India   the   others   namely   being,   Sanand,   Lucknow,   Pantnagar,   Dharwad   and \n\nJamshedpur which rolls out a plethora of different Vehicles at will.  If we were to focus on the CVBU Unit \nwhich  quintessentially  deals  with  Commercial  Vehicles,  The  Pune  plant  manufactures  a  range  of  LCV, \nM&HCV  Trucks  the  prominent  ones being ULTRA, Xenon Pickup, the vintage SFC™s and LPT Models. \nMeanwhile  drifting  our  attention  towards  the  PVBU  Unit,  a  cornucopia  of  Hatchbacks,  Sedans,  Utility \nVehicles and Stylebacks await us. Also, reportedly Tata™s principal subsidiaries the English  Jaguar  and \nLandrovers are also assembled from broken down stage. Hexa, Tigor, Zest and Tiago have now become \nhousehold names in the Indian Market.  The CVBU Unit has a Human Resource Division, a Central Office \nBuilding, Manufacturing Division, Various Part and Vehicle Assembly Shops, the ERC which takes care of \nthe Design Aspect, Business Excellence Services, Quality Division and associated divisions. It definitely is \none amongst the State of the Art Automotive Manufacturing Facilities which embraces the philosophies \nof  Lean  Manufacturing,  Maynard  Operations  Sequence  Techniques  and  of  Sustainable  Manufacturing \nthat being inculcated from its parent company™s core philosophy. Pune™s Robustness, Devoted Work \nEthic and an Innovative Visionary Approach have made it possible to be consistently among the Awards \ntwo  of  which  being  in  the  realm  of  LCA  and  Energy  Efficiency  respectively  testament  to  it™s \ncommitment to Sustainable Development. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Production Techniques -1 and 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

Credit  Suisse as part of its risk management deals with majorly three  types  of risks- \nMarket  Risk,  Credit  Risk  and  Operational  Risk.  As  part  of  Scenario  Design  team,  I  got  to  learn  about \nvarious  factors  that  decide  the  its / losses  made  in  the  portfolios  example  the  movements  in  Interest \nrates,  Forex  and  Commodities.  An  important  feature  of  keeping  a  cap  on  these  risks  is  to  be  able  to \nforesee  the  major market  moves  which  necessitate  generation  of  Scenarios  on  our  portfolios.  In  this \nanalysis, the idea is to bump various parameters like the Spot price, the Volatility or the Correlation and \nthen see the impact of these bumps on our portfolio. Finally the drivers of our losses are figured out and \naccording to the risk limits that we allot, information is conveyed to the traders. The significance of risk \nmanagement  has  risen  following  various  financial  crisis  events  involving  collapse  of  major  financial \nentities  and  hence  being  a  part  of  a  team  like  this  helped  me  develop  an  understanding  of  the  crucial \nprocesses that are driving the trades being placed in the front office. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Regression Analysis. \nObjectives of the project: Deliver Stress Testing Scenarios \nOutcomes of the project: Helped the team in delivering the stress testing scenarios for Regulatory and \nInternal Purposes. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Learnt  how  to  project  the  macroeconomic  and  market  data  for  various \nregulatory and internal scenarios \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Credit Suisse has provided \nan excellent platform for learning in the form of various Study modules, guest lecture sessions and also \nweekly meetings to discuss concepts within teams.

The  Practice \nschool  program  was  a  major  transition  from  theoretical  based  knowledge  to  a  real  world  scenario,  it \nhelped me to get a different perspective overall. Myself being from a Chemical engineering background \nwith no prior  business  acumen actually found it much interesting to get through this consulting phase. \nDuring  this  brief  stint  at  the  EY,  i  got  the  opportunities  to  involve  myself  in  different  activities  ranging \nfrom  client  meetings,  conferences,  team  meets,  routine  discussions  and  seminars.  Most  of  the  team \n\nmembers were experienced and subject matter experts in their domain. One of the best things i like was \nthe EY's internal webinars and knowledge factory portal which provided a comprehensive list and tools \nfor all the career path domains along with the previous engagements proposals. It really helped to get \nacquainted with functioning of whole management and other domains too.  My first project started with \nthe Business Model Development for a private client. And this was the first time when i actually realized \nthe true potential of MS-Excel(Power Pivot).Then the following few weeks, I spent my time learning MS-\noffice applications (Excel, Word and PowerPoint, VBA) and continued to hone these skills further down \nthe  line.  Then,  i  was  assigned  the  task  of  conducting  workshops  on  \"Demand  Side  Management  and \nEnergy Efficiency\" for circle level officials of DISCOMs (Distribution Companies) for a client, as a part of \nthe  project  .It  included  logistics  management,  project  management,  budgeting,  co-ordination  with  the \ngovernment officials. Finally, it concluded with the report submission to the client encompassing all the \nbriefings of the workshop and a case study on the Power scenario for that particular state. I would like \nto  extend  my  thanks  to  the  team  for  their  constant  support  and  help  throughout  the  tenure.  It  was  a \nwonderful experience working with the EY. \nObjectives of the project: To conduct  capacity building workshops on \"Demand Side  Management and \nEnergy  Efficiency\"  for  the  circle  level  officials  of  DISCOMs,  Report  submission  to  client  based  on  the \nworkshops \nOutcomes of the project: Successfully Conduction of workshops,Report prepared for client based on the \nanalysis done from workshops inputs, Developed a case study for Power Scenario in State(Confidential) \nMajor   Learning   Outcomes: Project   Management,   Logistics   Management,   Business   writing   and \ncommunication skills, budgeting \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company:  The  first  two days  at  EY \nwere bit embarrassing, as this much is the time it took us to realize that #Professionalism is not what we \nthink  of. So,  the  first  day  there  we  were,  dressed  up  in  formals,  entered  the  mess  and  wow!  so  many \neyes  glued to us, felt  good!! Then came  the second day,  entered, same  attire,  but  this time  too- much \nwow! But wait, we figured it out this time. So, the reason for us being in limelight for 2 days was none \nother than our Tie! Actually, we were the only ones dressed up in perfect formals while the others were \nin  their  business  casuals. Cut  to  the  chase  now.  Working  at  EY  was  a  phenomenal  opportunity  for  me. \nThere you will get to meet up a lot of people from the different sectors including Social, Power, IT, Audit, \nTransaction etc from novice to the expert experience level of candidates. You go and talk them out for \n\nany help. You will be amazed to know how much willing they are to help you. And the best part is that \nyou  get  to  learn  a  lot  from  the  experiences  and  wisdom  of  ages  garnered  by  those people  over  time. \nMost of the members of my team were subject matter experts in their respective domains which helped \nme  a  lot  as  they  were  easily  approachable  for  any  guidance  throughout.  I  would  like  to  extends  my \nthanks to the team for their constant support and help throughout the tenure. Working with the team in \nthis learning environment has really boosted my skill sets and made this PS2 a wonderful experience. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: No relevant course done by me \n \n "

I  worked  in  Business  Advisory  in  the \nGovernment Sector in the Power and Utilities domain. The team I worked with is actively engaged with \nboth government and private clients in the renewable energy sector.  My projects dealt with two broad \ntopics: Distributed Energy Resources and Grid Connected Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic (GRSPV). I worked \non one knowledge paper, one business proposal and multiple presentations during my tenure at EY. The \nprojects dealt with global DER markets and business model development for GRSPV penetration in India. \nI,  under  the  guidance  of  senior consultants,  was  delegated  the  duty  of  analysing  global  DER  market \nlandscapes, identifying market signals for increased uptake of renewable and consulting stakeholders in \norder  to  understand  the  challenges  faced  by  GRSPV  for  penetrating  the  Indian  market. Apart  from \nworking on reports and presentations, I was also exposed to multiple client interactions. While working \non another project, I was given the responsibility of coordinating capacity building workshops for State \nElectricity  Distribution  Companies  in  Bihar  and  Odisha.  I  was  also  given  the  opportunity  to  attend \nvarious  conferences  and  summits  related  to  the  Renewable  and  Electric  Vehicle  space.  Working  at  EY \nprovided me with great exposure to the consulting sector and provided me with immense knowledge of \nthe intricacies of the Indian power market. I would like to thank  the PS Division and EY India profusely \nfor this opportunity. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w):  Microsoft PowerPoint, Pro-Ex (proprietary EY software) \n\nObjectives  of  the  project: To  create  a  knowledge  report  that  analyses  the  global  Distributed  Energy \nResources  (DER)  Market,  the  benefits  of  DER  adoption  for  India  and  the  challenges  faced  in  increasing \nthe penetration of Rooftop Solar in India. \nOutcomes of the project: The roadmap for increased DER adoption was understood and Rooftop Solar \nwas identified as a key sector for India with regards to increasing DER adoption. The challenges faced in \nrooftop  solar  penetration  were  understood  and  various  business  models  were  analysed  and  their \napplicability were suggested. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Sector  knowledge  of  the  business  aspects  of  the  Indian  Electricity  market \nwas  gained.  Business  models  for  rooftop  solar  were  understood  in  detail.  Various  soft  skills  such as \npresentation skills, client interaction etiquettes, business writing styles etc. were learnt. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: I had a chance to complete \nmy  PS-2  at  Ernst  &  Young  LLP's  office  at  Golf  View  Tower, Gurugram  which  houses  EY  professionals \nworking  in  different  service  lines  such  as  Advisory,  Transactions,  Tax  and  Assurance. The  working \nenvironment  at  EY  is  highly  professional.  All  the  colleagues  I  had  a  chance  to  work  with  were  very \nambitious and extremely efficient. Professionals at EY work  under strict  deadlines  and work hours may \noften  be  long. Employees  are  expected  to  maintain  a  professional  demeanour  at  all  points  of  time.  In \nthis regard there are various trainings and workshops held at regular intervals which provide employees \na  chance  to  hone  soft  skills  such  as  business  etiquette,  writing  styles,  presentation  abilities  etc.  The \nculture at EY stems from  ̃asking better questions to build  a  better  working  world.  Questioning  the \nstatus quo and the reasoning behind every decision is encouraged at all levels in the organisation. EY™s \ncore values:  ̃Integrity™,  ̃Respect™,  ̃Teaming™,  ̃Courage to Lead™ and  ̃Building Relationships™ are \nadhered  to  by  all  in  the  organisation. I  expected  the  organisation  to  provide  me  with  a  platform  to \nengage  in difficult business problems and to understand first-hand how such problems are  solved. This \nwas an experience which was granted to during my tenure in the organisation. EY is a great place to gain \ncorporate  exposure  and my  time  spent  at  the  organisation  has  helped  me  gain  a  lot  in  terms  of  my \noverall development and I thank the PS Division and EY India for this opportunity. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Principles of Management, Energy Economics and Policy, \nFinancial Management, Technical Report Writing \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "

The objective of the projects  undertaken is to develop models that  give \ndecent  predictions on the data, predominantly in the form of images. This is achieved by machine  and \ndeep  learning  methods/techniques  where  in  a  model  is  trained  on  a  major  chunk  of  the  data  called \ntraining set and validating the model on remaining data called validation set. Thus trained model then is \nused for predictions. Input images used for training as well as validation can be of various sizes, shapes \nand types  such as Black  and White images,  color images,  satellite  images  etc. Further the problem can \nbe a classification problem or the regression problem. To develop an understanding of the task at hand \n\nand  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  project,  the  concepts  of  Deep  learning  such  as  Convolutional \nNeural  Networks  (CNNs)  for  classification  problems,  Region  based  CNNs  (R-CNNs),  Fast  and  Faster  R-\nCNNs  for  regression  problems  have  been  studied.  A  few  machine  learning  concepts  such  as  model \nstructure, optimization techniques like gradient descent, bias variance tradeoff have also been studied. \nTo implement these theoretical concepts, Python language and APIs mainly TensorFlow, Keras are used. \nThe  following  are  the  projects  undertaken  during  the  internship: The  first  project  is  a  regression \nmachine  learning  problem  where  in  crop  yields  are  to  be  predicted. The  second  project  is  on  object \ndetection.Apart  from  projects,  the  following  tasks  are  also  assigned: Sessions  on  machine  and  deep \nlearning mainly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the entire team.  Sessions on TensorFlow API \nfor the entire team. Readings on topics such as Online Offline Learning, Reinforcement Learning etc. and \nother minor tasks as instructed by the manager. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Python  is  used  for  writing  the  code.  Open  source \ndistribution, Anaconda, is used for Python installation as well as Python interpreter. For developing the \nmodels™ architecture, APIs such as TensorFlow and Keras are used. \nObjectives of the project: To develop deep learning models for computer vision problems \nOutcomes  of  the  project: Deep  Learning  models  have  been  developed  for  the  projects.  The  projects \nundertaken  are  a part  of  the  newly  launched  initiative  by  Genpact  called  Genpact  Cora  which  aims  to \nbring in digital transformation using the AI based platform and thus to create an industry first-AI for the \nreal world. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Student  has  learnt the  following  new  concepts. Basic  concepts  of  Machine \nLearning. Idea  and  functioning  of  Convolutional  Neural  Networks  (CNNs)  of  Deep  learning. Idea  and \nfunctioning  of  a  few  state  of  the art  models  in  Object  detection. Basic  concepts  of  Reinforcement \nLearning. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The working environment \nis a pleasant one. There is no pressure on us and we are given enough freedom to explore our ideas for \nthe projects. Also sufficient time was given to learn new concepts which we hadn't studied previously on \ncampus.  The  managers  know  the  limitations  of  interns  and  thus  have  given  us  work  accordingly \nproviding  enough  space.  As  a  result,  I  think  that  we  have  performed  well  and  have  been  able  to meet \nthe expectations of the company. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: C programming, Optimization, Machine Learning, Neural \nNetworks. \n "

I  learnt  about  data  warehousing  and  analytical  reporting  tools  which  majorly \nimpacted  functions  across  the  division  reducing  their  reporting  time  from  monthly  to  daily  basis  and \ndrastically   reducing   manual   labour,   hence   increasing   the   efficiency,   which   I   believe   is   a   major \nachievement  for  the  firm.  The  Goldman  experience  helped  me  understand  how  the  corporate  world \nlooks  and  works  like.  It  helped  me  apply  my  technical  knowledge  to  practical  scenarios,  transitioning \nfrom  learning  in college  to  application  in  the  firm.  The  most  important  thing that  I  take  back  from  this \nwhole experience is grooving yourself around people and deadlines. I learnt to chart out the agenda and \ndeliverables  and  then  plan  the  timelines  accordingly.  I  would  take  this  opportunity  to  bring  into  the \n\npicture the vast amounts of technical knowledge I learnt in the form of tools that helped me expand my \nknowledge  base  in  Big  Data  domain.  This  experience  gave  me  a  further  boost  in  this  space  which  will \ncome handy for my future projects and greatly increasing my chances for career in analytics. \n \n "

For my BD project of Himachal Pradesh I got to know it seeks \nto  harness  the  fullest  potential  of  the  state  for  development  of  tourism.  This  state  is  beautifully \nbestowed  with  unique  beauty  and  has  lush  green  valleys,  snow  covered  Himalayan  ranges,  welcoming \npeople,  serene  and  peaceful  environment.  Despite  of  all  the  above  factors,  there  are  many  places  in \nHimachal  Pradesh  which  are  lesser  known  and  are  unvisited.  Himachal  Pradesh  with  its  serene  and \nmesmerizing  beauty  has  no  wonder  attracted  millions  of  tourists  from  across  the  world,  but  there  still \nexist numerous unexplored destinations that call for our arrival each day of the year. There are diverse \nlocations in the small state of Himachal that are yet to be explored by the tourists similarly for Nepal, Sri \nLanka  and  Rajasthan  too.  The  underlying  reasons  are  that  either  the  regions  are  underdeveloped,  not \nsafe  enough  owing  to  mountainous  terrains  and  bumpy,  irregular  paths  or  maybe  due  to  extreme \nclimatic  conditions.  For  repository  part  availability  of  collated  information,  on  external  and  internal \nassistance  for  project  development  support  in  the  country  can  serve  as  a  vital  repository  and  an \n\nimportant catalyst for infrastructure development. This information can be utilized by the line ministries \nand various government agencies to track the support available through various sources and also help in \nchannelizing  the  same  to  the  target  geographies  and  sectors.  For  the  Varanasi  Smart  city  project  we \nwent to Varanasi and focused on the waste management solution. With the help of GPS Map Camera we \ndid  the  Geo  Tagging  of  all  the  Kudaghars  along  with  the  pic  of  every  Kudaghars.  We  asked  the  local \nsanitary  workers  for  the  nearby  places  names  from  where  the  wastes  are  dumped  at  the  specific \nkudaghar. With the help of Latitude Longitude App we found out the coordinate of these places. Out of \nthe 46, there were some places where the dumping is now stopped and the capacity is also zero as per \nthe VNN list. So finally after doing the survey we were left with 33 locations of Kudaghar of our interest. \nWe identified three location as Transfer Stations which includes Bakriya Kund, Bhavnia Phokhari and IDH \nGolconda.  We  marked  all  the  Kudaghars  and  Transfer  stations  on  the  map  with  the  help  of  Autocad. \nOverall it was a great learning throughout the PS. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Ms- office, Auto Distance App, GPS Map Camera. \nObjectives of the project: Tourism Development Proposal, Varanasi smart city project, figure out \ntourism tenders \nOutcomes of the project: Varanasi smart city report was submitted in Ministry. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: Learnt to make DPR, got exposure of real time projects and field experience. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Working condition was \nawesome.

The major project was a research project on Electric vehicles (EV) involving the \nstudy  and  analysis  of  recent  trends  and  developments  in  EV  space.  Also,  I  had  to  develop  a  statistical \nmodel in order to make projections of future values of Annual EV sales, EV market shares and EV stocks \nin  the  world's  leading  markets.  The  miscellaneous  other  projects  were  in  the  domain  of  advisory  and \nconsulting  services  to  the  clients  of  PwC.  I  worked  under  the  strategic  business  unit  of  Government \nReforms  &  Infrastructure  Development  (GRID)  in  the  Advisory  line  of  service.  My  projects  were  in  the \nenergy  sector.  The  clients  were  government  power  sector  undertakings  such  as  Madhya  Pradesh  Urja \nVikas  Nigam  Ltd.  and  electricity  regulatory  commissions  such  as  Jharkhand  State  Electricty Regulatory \nCommission (JSERC). The various projects  given to me  included preparing regulatory orders,  filing tariff \npetitions, making detailed project reports and spreadsheet models, delivering presentations etc. \n\nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): The work here involved heavy usage of Office softwares \nsuch as MS- Excel, MS- Word & MS- Powerpoint. So, a higher level proficiency in these is definitely going \nto help a lot. \nObjectives of the project: The major project  involves performing a comprehensive  study of EVs. Broad \nobjectives are to: 1.Find out the leading countries in the Electric Vehicle (EV) space and select them for \nperforming all analyses.  2. Compile all the governmental policies, regulations, incentives & subsidies for \nthe encouragement of adoption of electric vehicles in various countries. 3. Study and list all the targets \nset up by governments of selected countries, in the EV space. 4. Create a statistical model to make the \nfuture predictions of the annual sales of EVs, the market shares of EVs and the total stock of EVs in the \nselected  countries  for  the  period  2017-30.  5.  Make  all  the  required  projections  for  the  future  and \ncompare  the  future  market  shares  of  EVs  to  the  present  ones  in  all  the  selected  countries.  6.  Perform \nthe aggregation of both, the  estimates of annual EV sales as well as the  estimates of total stock of EVs \nper year in the selected countries, in order to get a global overview. 7. Provide estimates of the number \nof  chargers  required  for  the  selected  countries  in 2020  and  2030  and  compare  them  to  the  targets  for \ncharging infrastructure (if any). The objectives of other allotted projects were: 1. Development of a true-\nup  order  of  Annual  Revenue  Requirement  for  2015-16  for  JSERC,  after  obtaining  its  approvals.  2. \nAnother project involved the development of a Multi-year Tariff (MYT) order of JSERC for a period of 5 \nyears (2016-17 to 2020-21). 3. ERP Implementation at MP Urja Vikas Nigam Limited- The work involved \nsegregation and classification of hundreds of hard-copy files of the organisation into various categories \nand  sub-categories,  their  numbering  and  preparation  of  a  chart  of  classification  using  a  suitable \nsoftware. \nOutcomes of the project:  1. A comprehensive study of electric vehicles was performed, which includes \ntheir history, development, technology, types and components. \n2. The present scenario of electric vehicles around the world was analysed and the leading countries in \nthe EV space were identified for further study. \n3. The presence of charging infrastructure in various countries was studied and the availability of \ncharging infrastructure versus the stock of electric vehicles in each country was analysed. \n4. Based on collection of information from various sources, exhaustive lists of both governmental \nincentives, subsidies and incentives for electric vehicles and of the national targets in all the selected \ncountries were prepared. \n5. A statistical model was developed to project future values of annual EV sales, EV stocks and EV market \nshares in each of the countries. Analysis was done for each country individually. \n6. Finally, the predicted values of various parameters were compared with the targeted values. Suitable \nconclusions were drawn and recommendations were made based on the above. \n7. The True-up & MYT documents were successfully prepared for JSERC and the assigned work in ERP \nimplementation was successfully completed. \n\nMajor Learning Outcomes: 1. Gained knowledge of various statistical tools and predictive modelling \n2. Enhanced skills in MS-Excel, MS-Powerpoint & MS-Word softwares \n3. Gained a thorough knowledge and understanding of electric vehicles, electric vehicles industry and \nthe potential of future adoption. \n4. Learned about the power generation, transmission & distribution structures of various states of India \n5. Learned about the revenue model of power generation and distribution in various states. \n6. Improved presentation, communication and other soft skills. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The projects allotted to \nstudents from BITS are generally advisory and consulting projects in government sectors such as energy, \ninfrastructure etc. The work may require one to travel to another city from the base office location. So, \none must be prepared for that. This was the case with me as I worked from the client™s location, while \nmy base office was in Gurgaon. The working environment mostly depends on the work location \n(corporate office or client™s office), city and very importantly the closest team members you are \nworking with. In my case, the team that I worked with was really very friendly and supportive. The team \nmembers gave me time to settle down. Also, I frequently used to interact with senior members of the \nteam such as Associate Directors and Principal Consultants and really got to learn a lot from them. I \nbelieve it is a very good opportunity as you are getting to interact with such senior people in the \ncorporate world so early on in your career. The projects involved a lot of discussions and teamwork. I \nundertook a research-based project and multiple other projects to provide advisory and consulting \nservices to the clients. Good guidance was provided by the team members regularly. So, the above was \nmy experience. I cannot say much about the head office in Gurgaon as I didn™t work from there. Please \nnote that the first few days at the company will be quite hectic, but it becomes better as one starts \nsettling down. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Project Appraisal, Probability & Statistics, Principles of \nEconomics, Techniques in Social Research, Technical Report Writing \n \n "

The first project was Practical Action based in Bangladesh which is related to Sandbar \nCropping.  I  did  extensive secondary  research  and  after  that  prepared  business  models  which  were \nprepared  for  the  self  sustainability  of  the  farmers  engaged  in  Sandbar  Cropping.  Similar  I  worked  for \nReel  Gardening  project  in  African  countries  and  again  did  research  work  about  various  foundations \nengaged  and  NGOs.  Apart  from  that  I  worked  for  Axis  Bank  foundation  project,  YES  foundation,  Titan \nImpact Awards in which I designed questionnaires for data collection, checked progress report of various \ninterns  working  in  different  NGOs  and sent  mails  to  organisations  for  Titan  Awards.  Later  on  I  started \nworking on Digital Financial Inclusion in which I did research and data analysis on various types of data \nof  NABARD  and  Census.  I  transcribed  a  lot  of  telephone  interviews  and  derived  conclusions  based  on \nopinions  of  various  industry  leaders  and  experts  and  did  a  lot  of  secondary  research  on  various  digital \nfinancial  inclusion  components.  Later  I  had  to  contribute  in  writing  the  white  paper  for  the  CII  on  the \nimpact of digitization on tourism, Logistics, Information and technology etc. in India in which secondary \nresearch work was involved. \n\nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): MS-Excel, MS Word, Social Cops, \nObjectives  of  the  project: To  understand  the  impacts  of  Digital  Financial Inclusion  and  how  to \nimplement  Digital  Financial  Inclusion  in  whole  India.  To  make  the  farmers  of  Sandbar  Cropping  Self \nSustainable in Bangladesh \nOutcomes  of  the  project: The  business  models  for  the  successful  self  sustainability  of  the  Sandbar \nCropping farmer was prepared based on research and data analysis. The Digital Financial Inclusion going \nin whole country was understood and the data was analysed for the publication of the report. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Learnt  about  the  above  mentioned  projects  and how  the  research  and \nanalysis  are  done  in  the  social  sector  companies  and  the  impact  of  these  projects  in  the  respective \nsectors. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  work  which  we  did \nmostly  was  secondary  research which  helped  us  gaining  a  lot  of  information  on  various  sectors  but  at \nthe  same  time  it  was  a  bit  monotonous  sometimes  as  we  did  not  get  to  learn  any  new  software  or \nthings. Our involvement was well taken care of and we were pushed to do good work. They should give \nmore  and  more  exposure  to  different  projects  going  on  in  the  company.  The  secondary  research  at \ntimes was a bit disorganized because of the huge amount, but it helped us gaining a lot of insights in the \nsectors.  The  company  should  give  a  little  bit  more  difficult  tasks  which  help  the  interns  learning  new \nskills so that they can use it at other companies as well. \nAcademic   courses   relevant   to   the   project: Not   really   but   good   knowledge   of   Data   Analysis   is \nrecommended \n \n "

				"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II: Market analysis, creating better presentations according to \nclient requirements, Introduction to search engines like LinkedIN, Naukri, Google etc.  \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint \nObjectives  of  the  project: Client  is  looking  to  acquire  companies  in  different  verticals  like  DevOps, \nAutomotive,  Internet  of  Things(IoT),  Analytics,  Security,  Technology  Service  Providers(TSP)  etc.  Zinnov \nwill provide them with the knowledge database of leading companies in these fields and provide a deep-\ndive  into  the top 10-12  companies  to  provide  a  holistic overview  of the  companies  to client  which  will \nhelp them decide on a specific acquisition.   \nOutcomes of the project: We provided the client with a holistic representation of the companies in the \nautomotive industry. We shipped the deliverable to the client and are waiting for their feedback. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: 1. Advanced  Excel  is  a  very  useful  skill  in  consulting  because  whatever \nmarket research is done, the data is saved in the form of an Excel sheet. This data is collected depending \non how deep the company must be analyzed. \n2. Presenting data is a very important skill as clients don™t want to listen huge numbers during a \npitch. They want the information to be crisp and to the point. Seeing a slide with various graphs, logos \nand the insights we derived from the data is useful during client meetings. \n3. Market  sizing  is  important  when  you  are  expecting  a  disruptor  in  the  market.  For  example, \nInternet of Things is a disruptor in the current market. To estimate how  much of the market share IoT \nwill  have,  we  need  to  first  size  the  entire  market  of  the  already  existing  IoT  market.  There  are  two \napproaches to this: Top-down and Bottom-up. In the Top-down approach, we take some companies and \ncalculate  their  R&D  spend  and  their  market  share.  Then  we  calculate the  revenue  based  on  this \npercentage  for  different  industry.  This  is  usually  done  for  industrial  reports  which  require  a  mere \nnumber.  In  the  Bottom-up  approach,  we  take  the  actual  numbers  (R&D  spend)  of  different  companies \nfrom their annual reports and then estimate how much percentage of that is going to different verticals.  \n4. There  are  projects  like  M&A  (Mergers  and  Acquisitions),  Private  Equity  and  Vertical  addition \nprojects  for  which  clients  will  extend  their  requirements  for  different  industry.  For example,  a  client \n\nwishes to acquire a company in the Automotive  industry. The client would want  to acquire a company \nwhose  employees  are  less  than  100  or  200,  revenue  less  than  10  million  dollars  and  would  prefer  a \ncompany  which  has  some  assets  or  some  intellectual  property  which  it  could  leverage.  So,  we  analyze \nthe  industry  and  make  a  list  of  10-20  companies.  We  then  present  the  client  a  deep-dive  of  each \ncompany and then provide a rating of the top 10 companies so that the  client can decide about which \ncompany to be acquire. These are some things which I learnt during my PS-II. I also learnt how to behave \nin an office, when to put forward your opinion and when not to and to adhere to deadlines. I hope this \nexperience will help me in the long run and help me grow wherever I am. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Zinnov  is  a  private \nmanagement consulting company. It was established in 2001 with headquarters in Bangalore and other \noffices  in  Gurgaon,  Texas  and  California.  They  offer  variety  of  services  in  the  field  of  management \nconsulting. They work with different clients, some of who include the world™s largest consumer \nelectronics  company  and  the  leading  producer  of  cars  and  commercial  vehicles.  Working  at  Zinnov \nmeans facing a new challenge every single day. It is difficult but also very interesting. The work culture \nof Zinnov is purely professional kindled with interpersonal nurturing and connected growth. The kind of \nprojects  we  take  up  on  an  everyday  basis  are  mainly  in  the  field  of  strategy  which  need  at  most \nattention to detail and careful segregation. \n "

The ability to work for long hours is also a prerequisite here.\nDetails of papers / patents: None\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Unfortunately,\nthe entire internship was WFH, so interaction with office staff was limited only to work and there\nwas practically no relationship building. However, as far as work is considered, it's extremely\nhigh pressure and interns have to do a lot of work, sometimes as interesting as running models\nfor generating location specific talent data and making guesstimates and sometimes as boring\nas excel data entry. If someone is interested in consulting, the braindesk team within DRAUP\nprovides   a   great   learning   curve,   however,   the   working   hours   exceed   7   hours   daily   and\nsometimes extend till 12 / 13 hours too.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: EPS, TRW.\n682\n"

The problem with \nthis approach is that it only works well for checking logic which has non-temporal behavior.

				"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II: I was a part of FEV (Formal Equivalence Verification) team in \nthe  HPG  (High  Veloctiy  Project)  group  of  Intel.  FEV  is  a  crucial  part  of  the  physical  design  flow,  which \nproves  or  disproves  the  equivalence  of  two  designs  by  using  complex  mathematical  algorithms.  The \nequivalence check could be done for RTL vs RTL, RTL vs compile, RTL vs synthesis, synthesis vs APR and \nso  on.  Intel,  so  does  any  other  chip  manufacturing  company  i  guess,  uses  milestones  to  signify  the \nprogress in their project. For each milestone we will be getting new RTL, APR, SYN which would either be \na slight or significant modification of the earlier milestone. Our job is to ensure that various stages of a \npartition  (synthesis,  APR,  rtl)  are  logically  equivalent  to  one  another.  We  used  cadence  Conformal  for \nthis purpose. The flow to check the equivalence is pretty much automated by a back-end team. Once we \nfire the flow and the runs come out, we have to see if there are any non equivalents present in the two \ndesigns.  If  so,  we  start  debugging  to  see  why  those noneqs  are  present,  setup  the  necessary overrides \nand refire runs and continue this process until we have zero NonEqs. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Cadence Conformal \nObjectives of the project: Understanding formal equivalence verification \nOutcomes of the project: I am the FEV owner of 5 partitions. I started at 0.5 mile in July, now we are at \n1p0 as of December. I got all my partitions clean as of now. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: Understanding Formal Equivalence Verification \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The working environment \nis pretty much like any other corporate company. One thing that i observed from my coworkers here is \nthat  they  are  highly  competitive  and  are  always  willing  to  learn.  They  pay  extreme  attention  to  detail. \nCurrently  there  is  a  massive  expansion  going  on  the  Intel  as  a  whole  and  there  is  a  lot  of  hiring \nhappening.  Some  of  us  including  myself  were  offered  a  position  here  but  they  wanted  us  to  join  in \nJanuary,  which  obviously  was  not possible  as  it  is  against  academic  rules.  Mentors  and  Managers  here \nare inclined towards M.Tech or M.E. interns, which is to be expected i suppose as they are significantly \nmore  exposed  to  the  field  of  electronics  (  or  an  equivalent  field  you  name)  than  us  the  B.E    interns. \n\nThankfully my PS2 project was decent and i was able to contribute a considerable chunk to the ongoing \nHPG  project,  which  is  to  be  taped  in  soon.  But  i  heard  my  other  peers  here  say  their  projects  are  not \nvery   good.   So   i   guess   Intel   Environment   will   be   well   suited   for   ME   graduates   more   than   BE \nundergraduates. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Digital Design, ADVD \n "

I have been working here for the last five months in the Automotive Software team. \nIn the initial few weeks  I got to learn and get accustomed to the work environment and developed my \nsoftware skills required for the internship.  I got to understand the concept of camera calibration which \nhelps  in  reconstruction  of  the  world  model  with  minimal  error.  This  is  very  important  because  when \nthese cameras are put into use in a self driving car, reconstructing world objects with utmost accuracy is \nneeded  for  safety  reasons. I  got  to  work  with  certain  open  source  libraries  like  Ceres,  Eigen,  LAPACK \nwhich  have  been  used  with  C++  and  one  of  my  tasks  was  to  replace  these  open  source  libraries  with \nCUDA  libraries  for  carrying  out computations  on  GPU.    The  tasks  assigned  to  me  gave  me  a  practical \nexperience  on  the  live  projects  and  as  a  result  I  got  to  learn  a  lot  more  about  the  team's  job.  I  also \nanalyzed certain auto-calibration algorithms for efficiency in order to find out which ones would help my \nteam's  cause.    All  this  work  has  helped  me  improve  my  skills  in  C  programming,  Linux  Shell  Scripting \nalong with an understanding of GIT and CUDA.

Autocalibration  was  studied  and  the  difference  between \ncalibration  and  autocalibration  algorithms  became  clear.  Effect  of  multiple  transformations  including \nworld  to  camera,  camera  to  rig,  rig  to  world  were  understood.

Catalogue  Server:  Implemented  a  NodeJS  server  that \nstores  details  of  devices  connected  to  the  middleware  like  format  of  data  being  streamed,  device \nlocation, owner, provider etc. The server stores certain schemas against which each device entry being \nposted to the server is validated so that each entry is present in the requisite format. This makes it very \neasy  for  third  party  developers  who  have  access  to  the  device  details  to  request  the  database  in  a \nuniform  manner.  Also,  the  server  provides  basic  LDAP  authentication  so  that  any  user  altering  the \n\ndatabase  can  do  so  only  when  they  have  authorisation.  Further,  the  server  also  has  a  basic  AngularJS \napp that displays some graphical data like number and types of devices etc. \n2. Web Application: The web application developed queries the catalogue for a particular item and then \ndisplays  live  stream data being received from the middleware. It also displays the  pin point  location of \nthe device on a strip of google maps. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): NodeJS, AngularJS, D3js, AJV validator, LDAPjs, amqplib \nObjectives of the project: Implement a Catalogue Server for the Middleware being developed under the \nSmart Cities Project.

There  has  been  a  consistent  requirement  and  push  towards  driving  the  test  cost \n\nlower.

In online \nadvertising, the  decision of which ad is to be  placed on what site  is decided algorithmically,  and hence \nthe  advertiser  doesn't  know  which  site  his  ad  will  be  placed  on.  Due  to  a  steady  increase  in  extreme \ncontent on the internet, advertisers are more concerned than before about their brand advertisements \nappearing  next  to  such  content.  Amazon,  as  one  of  the  leading  digital  advertising  networks,  has  been \nparticularly   concerned   regarding   protecting   the   brand   image   of   advertisers.   My   project   was   an \nexploratory  one  which  involved  understanding  how  brand  safety  is  currently  ensured  by  Amazon, \nassessing  the  accuracy  of  our  third-party  brand  safety  partners,  experimenting  to  determine  gaps  in \ncurrent brand safety solution and estimating the extent of blind spots in our current  solution. The first \nphase  of my project  helped in establishing that the current model of evaluating brand safety of a page \nleaves a lot to be desired and should be improved upon to ensure that our advertisers are safeguarded. \nTo  narrow  down  on  what  areas  we  should  work  on,  I  developed  a  really  configurable  and  extensible \npipeline, exploiting the AWS cloud solutions, to discover new brand unsafe websites which can be used - \nto validate 3rd party signals, create a training dataset for brand safety model training and allow user to \nexperiment and find features that can be used in the model \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Used Scala programming language and Play framework for \nenhancing  an  internal  tool.  Used  Python  for  creating  Proof  of  Concept  of  the  experimental  pipeline. \nUsed AWS Tools like AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, Simple Storage Service, AWS Athena and Elastic \nCloud Compute \nObjectives  of  the  project: Finding  gaps  in  current  3rd  party  solutions,  experimenting  with  different \nappraches to fix the gaps, developing a pipeline to find websites similar in content to input URLs \nOutcomes  of  the  project: Analysis  of  current  brand  safety  systems,  Development  of  a  pipeline  to  find \nwebsites similar in content to input URLs \n\nMajor Learning Outcomes: I was assigned an independent project to work on. I was thus introduced to \nhow a development project is approached from scratch. I learned how to gather technical requirements \nfrom  ambiguous  business  requirements,  translate  them  into  a  flexible,  practical  and  cost-effective \ndesign and finally break down the design to small tasks which can be tracked in regular intervals. In the \ntechnical side, I improved upon my OOP  and parallel programming skills. I was introduced to functional \nprogramming (Scala). I also worked with Cloud and distributed computing (AWS Services). \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Amazon  provides  an \nenvironment which promotes learning.

My \nproject was to explore the usefulness of quantifying website quality in advertising business metrics such \nas Click through rate, consideration rate and conversion rate. I wrote javascript and scala code to extract \nfeatures  from  websites  at  scale.  I  then    cleaned,  transformed,  augmented,  and  visualized  the  data  to \nidentify trends in performance metrics attributed by these features. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Javascript,  Scala,  AWS  Technologies  (EC2,  S3,  SQS,  SNS, \nASG), Apache Hadoop, Spark, Zeppelin, PIG \nObjectives of the project: 1. Featurize  quality of a website  and extract them, 2. Analyse/Find trends in \nfeatures across sites \nOutcomes of the project: I improved the existing feature detection algorithms, and added new features \nand  algorithms  to  extract  over  25  features  per  webpage  at  high  precision.  This  feature  extraction \npipeline is implemented at scale, and tested. The features extracted for the sites were then interpreted \nagainst  advertising  performance  metrics  to  identify  ways  to  use  these  features  in  lifting  advertising \nperformance.  Several  features  showed  interesting  and  useful  trends,  they  are  still  undergoing  further \nexperimentation before being put into production. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: The  project  required  me  to  code  in  JavaScript  and  Scala.  It  was  great \nexposure to coding in the style where both functional and object-oriented paradigm were used, played \nto  their  strengths- writing pure  functions  at  method level,  using  immutable  objects  creating  code  with \nno  side  effects,  while  using  the  OOP  to  model  the  entities,  encapsulate  data  and  modularize  code.  I \nlearnt  to  use  several  big  data  and  AWS  technologies.  I  learnt  how  to  think  like  an  SDE,  keeping  in  my \nmind  the  following  while  developing  any  product - quality,  scalability,  reusability,  benchmarking  and \nwriting unit &  integration tests. I learnt several methods of data analysis, and how to approach solving \nqualitative problems.  I also learnt several leadership and interpersonal skills. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Under the guidance of a \nmentor, I was given a project to explore from start to finish. I was given the autonomy to make decisions \non various design, tech stack and implementation details of my solution. Even though Amazon is one of \nthe largest MNCs out there, all the teams within operate as fast paced, high energy startups. This \nenriched my internship experience as I could learn and work on a lot more in my 5.5month internship \nthan I expected. The team has regular sync-ups and demos of work done so far. I set up regular bi-\nweekly meetings with the stakeholders for my project to communicate updates and incorporate their \n\nideas/advice.

For the implementation of the project, I had \n\nto learn various concepts like model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, SQL and No SQL databases and \nknowledge of REST APIs . \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): The core development was done in JAVA 8 and the testing \nfor  the  back  end  was  done  using  Mockito  and  JUnit  frameworks.  As  part  of  front-end  designing  of  this \ntool,  I  worked  on  Ruby  on  Rails.  Ruby  on  Rails  is  a  server-side  web  application  framework  written  in \nRuby,  which  is a  high-level  object  oriented  programming  language.  Rails  is  a  model-view-controller \nframework. \nObjectives of the project: Tool development for validating business rules for fraud detection \nOutcomes of the project: A complete functioning service with an integrated back-end and front-end \nMajor Learning Outcomes: Apart from learning various software related concepts, I also got a flavor of \nthe life in IT industry. It is very important to be on your toes, responsive and pro-active when it comes to \ndelivering and meeting the deadlines one estimates. I also realised how working in industry is different \nfrom  academic  projects.  In  the  IT  industry  there  is  a  lot  of  emphasis  on  correcting  the  edge  cases \nassociated with  a  given  problem.  Also, the code  is  subjected to a  large  number  of  stress  tests  to  make \nthem  as  bug-proof  in  the  future  as  possible.  The  programs  are  also  reviewed  by  various  other \nexperienced developers to reduce possibility of bugs and to maintain a uniform coding standard within \nthe  team.  Moreover,  even  while  writing  the  code,  a  lot  of  emphasis  is  laid  on  making  it  based  on  the \nindustry  standards,  easy  to  read,  at  the  same  time  exploring  about  the  advancements  in  the  coding \npractices. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Here at Amazon, the best \npart  was  that  we  were  not  given  any  kind  of  spoon  feeding.  We  were  taught  to  expect  help  only  in \nminimal  matters.  The  solution  was  not  provided  directly.  We  were  asked  to  read  and  explore  on  our \nown. It was difficult at first but ultimately this made us independent and quick at problem identification \nand  resolution.  And  this  was  the  biggest  factor  in  helping  me  transition  from  academic  learning  to \nindustrial application. PS-2 helps one to build their persona, knowledge base and interact with industry \nexperts. The experience at PS-2 - if not affect my future career prospects - has at least made me aware \nof the current industry standard and situation and that adds to better chances at scoring a workplace in \nfuture. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Object Oriented Programming with JAVA, Databases, Data \nstructures and Algorithms. \n "

It \nwas a great experience as I had never worked on such a large scale before.    \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): java service framework, python, aws services, ruby on rails, \njs, haml, etc \nObjectives of the project: Training model and creating training dataset by creating manual labelling tool \nOutcomes of the project: Labelling tool and the apache spark model is being used for cross marketplace \nprediction. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: spring framework, ruby on rails, apache spark java, sklearn library, js, haml, \netc \nBrief Description of working environment,  expectations from the company: The  overall experience  at \nAmazon  Development  Center,  Bangalore  was  great  because  I  got  to  work  on  lots  of  new  and exciting \ntechnologies.  The  past  five  months  have  been  an  amazing  learning  opportunity.  The  timings  were \nflexible  and  work  culture  was  quite  chill.  My  manager  updated  me  with  every  new  technology  and \nactivity  of  the  team.   Apart  from  learning  various  software  related  concepts,  I  have  also  realized  how \nworking  in  industry  is  different  from  academic  projects.  In  industry  there  is  a  lot  of  emphasis  on \ncorrecting the corner cases associated with a given program. Also, the programs are subjected to large \nnumber of stress tests so as to make them as bug-proof and future-proof as possible. The programs are \nalso reviewed by various people to reduce possibility of bugs. Moreover, even while writing a program, a \nlot of emphasis is laid on making it easy to read, understand and manage. These kinds of programming \npractices are very typical to industry.Practice School experience has also helped us become familiar with \nthe required essional attitude and the working environment of companies. We also got an opportunity \nto  interact  with  and  learn  from  many  essionals  who  already  have  a  lot  of  experience  of  working  in \nindustry. The constructive feedback from them has helped us in developing new skills as well as refining \nother  skills.  Hence  Practice  school  has  provided  us  ample  opportunity  to  implement  the  techniques \n\nlearnt  in  classroom  as  well  as  learn  new  concepts.  I  sincerely  believe  that  due  to  this  hands-on \nexperience  we  are  now  better  prepared  for  the  future  and  experienced  gained  here  will  help  in \nsmoother transition from academics. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: ML, OS, CP, OOP \n "

It involved the development of a new module for automating the configuration of\nnodes and lanes corresponding to a major Amazon carrier. Apart from that, I had tasks for\nproviding certain feature updates to an existing automation web service. The tasks required a\nsound knowledge of AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, Redshift, RDS, etc.) and of\ninternal Amazon development infrastructure (e.g. build tools, code review, pipelines, etc.) as\nwell as of open source technologies and frameworks like spring MVC, JavaScript, Bootstrap,\nHTML / CSS.

The amount of work allotted is\nalso dependent on the team. Some teams allot one task at a time, while others assign you all of\nyour deliverables at the very beginning. A mix of the two can also be seen wherein you have\ncertain tasks assigned initially and then incremental tasks or feature updates assigned in\nbetween.\n2.It is expected that you become self-dependent and take ownership of your tasks. Once the\nmentor assigns some task to you, it is your responsibility to gather the required information you\nneed for the task, contact relevant people inside and outside the team, learn about the tech\nstack involved, and finally implement the task, etc.\n3.Most of the initial weeks' time will be spent learning about Amazon's internal development\ninfrastructure and build tools. Getting stuck will be a part of the process. Resolving your\nproblems on your own is a very important skill which you will learn.\n4.You may or may not need to work on weekends depending on the amount of work assigned \nto you.\n5.It is not possible to generalize the experience you will have at Amazon due to the presence of\na lot of development teams, with each team providing a different experience. However, a\ncommon aspect is that you definitely get to fast track your growth and learn a host of skills that\nare highly valued in the industry.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Object oriented programming, Data structures & \nalgorithms, Database systems, Logic in computer science, Computer networks."

A lot of time was invested into learning the basics of what we were going to do, including learning \nthe  libraries,  the  program architecture  and  the  corresponding  nuances  that  it  encompasses. The  time \nspent  on  programming  the  solution  was  no  too  much,  however,  it  too  demanded  some thinking. The \nmajority of time was  however spent in testing the  code. Since  there was  no simpler way to ensure  the \nfull working of the code  base,  regular trips with the bot  was  made,  in order to test every  phase  of the \nsolution  build. The  solution  we  made  was  broken down  into  the  following phases  :  Depth  Map \ngeneration,  2D  Mapping,  Localisation,  Implementing  static  transforms,  Waypoint  navigation, Obstacle \ndetection and avoidance, Autonomous functionality, IoT based control. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Turtlebot \nObjectives of the project: Inventory management and wifi mapping \nOutcomes of the project: ¢ Depth Map generation \n¢ 2D Mapping \n¢ Localisation \n¢ Implementing static transforms \n¢ Waypoint navigation \n¢ Obstacle detection and avoidance \n¢ Autonomous functionality \n¢ IoT based control \n\nMajor Learning Outcomes: Learnt ROS (robot Operating System) from scratch. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Everyone  at  cisco  is \nfriendly, you don't use sir/ma'am to address anyone, which makes it more cool.

Some  major  challenges  are:  ï‚·  Cost  ï‚·  Scalability  ï‚·  Ease  of  installation  ï‚· \nInteroperability ï‚· Privacy ï‚· Security The framework created in this project attempts to overcome these \nchallenges by utilizing existing devices and technologies. \nThe project consists of three major parts: \n1. Hardware and it's coding: The hardware was procured from external vendor. It was then coded to be \nconfigured by mobile app and then controlled and monitored using API's exposed by CAM. \n2.  Cisco  Asset  Manager  setup:  It  is  a  Cisco  proprietary  software  where  asset  properties,  logic  for \nmonitoring and control was defined and several API's were exposed for mobile app. \n3. Mobile App: An android app was developed which would fetch floor plan, device properties etc. from \nCAM for configuring IoT assets. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): CAM,  Android,AWS,  Javascript  H/w:  Electrodragon  Wi-Fi \nIoT Relay Board \nObjectives  of  the  project: The  project  aims  to  create  a  frame  work for  installing,  configuring  and  real \ntime monitoring of large number of IOT devices over multiple geographical locations in a easy, reliable, \nscalable, cost effective and secure manner. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: In  this  project  the  basic  framework  has  been created.  The  framework \ncomprises  of  Electrodragon  Wi-Fi  IOT  Relay  Board  Based  on  ESP8266,  Cisco  Asset  Manager  and  an \nandroid  app.  This  can  be  modified  for  other  types  of  IOT  devices  and  sensors  by  replacing  the \nElectrodragon module with appropriate module. \nSome  parts  need  modifications  to  improvise  it. The  interoperability  has  also  been  implemented.  There \nare few areas which requires better abstraction to enable easy adaption for other kinds of devices. \n\nMajor Learning Outcomes: Learning: \nTechnical skills : 1. Hardware coding 2. App development 3. Cisco Asset Management Software Suite 4. \nProtocols such as MQTT, TLS etc. \nOther skills : 1.Real world project  planning and development 2. Gaining new insight  and perspective  in \nthe field of Internet of things from experts at Cisco systems. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The working environment \nwas as follows: \n1. Transparent & Open Communication: Our mentor was very open to us and took our advice regularly \non the project. \n2. Work-Life Balance: We were encouraged to do a lot fun activities along with our daily work. \n3.

Applied for a patent which is yet to be granted, as mentioned below. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Apache Spark, Scala, Groovy, Java. \nObjectives of the project: To design and develop a real-time root cause analysis engine to be deployed \nover ditributed framework as microservices. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: The  latency  in  detection  of  root  cause  has  been  theoretically  resolved  to \nachieve  near  real-time  analysis.  Practically,  The  expression  engine  was  scaled  out  partially  to  enhance \ncalculations atleast X8 times faster than the existing product. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: Got  familar with scala and increased proficiency in Java. Cluster computing \nbasics. Patent filing gave a lot of technical and higher level exposure. \n\nDetails  of  papers/patents: Submitted  a  patent  on  'Method  and  Apparatus  for  Real  Time  Event \nCorrelation'  (Status:  Pending)  along  with  Ashwin  Daswani(2014A7PS119P).  The  patent  suggests  several \nmajor algorithmic changes in the approach of existing root cause analysis engines in networks such as to \nmake  the  whole  process  real-time  or  near  real-time  and  scaling  it  out  over  a  distributed,  cluster \ncomputing framework to reduce latency. \nBrief  Description  of  working   environment,  expectations  from  the  company: The  company  was \ngenerous  in  assigning  a  full  time  project  to  interns,  giving  them  ample  exposure  to  the  corporate \nworking. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Computer Networks, OOP, DSA. \n "

				"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \nShort  Summary  of  work  done  during  PS-II: My  work  in  the  company  focuses  on  developing  Network \nModels using languages like Groovy, TOSCA, etc. for the Modelling Engine which is the micro serviceable \ncomponent  for  the  product  called  SMARTS++ which  is  an  improvement  over  the  currently existing Dell \nEMC  product  SMARTS  to  provide  broader  use  of  Auto-scaling  Microservices,  Database  Persistence  and \nCustomization  to  the  end-user  and  change  the  existing  in-memory  data  storage  to  an  actual  graph \ndatabase.   We   decided   to   go   with   Groovy   further   and   then   performed   creation   and   testing   of \nmodels/templates.  Apart  from  this,  I  got  the  opportunity  to  build  and  execute  the  huge  codebase \nthrough which I learnt the application and implementation of tools and frameworks like grade, Maven, \nTestNG, JUnit, Eclipse, etc. \nObjectives of the project: develop the architecture of network modelling engine for nextgen smarts. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: The  main  objective  is  to  develop the  modelling  engine(Model  Manager) \ncomponent  for  NextGen  SMARTS  product.  Collected  the  requirements  from  clients  and  then  come  for \nthe scope on which we worked. Below it contains the abstract of these requirement tags. \nClass  Definitions:-             The  Model Manager  will  define  class  structures  for  each  Entity.  An  entity  can \nrepresent  a  component  of  a  network/cloud/storage  domain.  The  classes  will  be  defined  to  support  all \n\nobject-oriented  features  and  yet  it  should  be  independently  defined  so  that  it  entity  types  can  be \narbitrarily combined to form topologies.    \nRelationships and Reverse Relationships:-     The Model Manager will define relationships that will bind \nentities  to  other  entities.  The  relationship  types  will  be  defined  in  consultation  with  the  modules  that \ninterface  with  the  Model  Manager  such  as  Discovery  Engine  and  Expression  Engine.  A  class  can  define  \nboth Forward as well as Inverse releationship between entities to complete the relationship pair.   \nRelationship Sets:-   The Model Manager must have the capability to specify  one is too many and many \nis too many  relationships between two entities through the relationshipSet keyword \nAttributes :- The Model Manager will classify the attributes of the entities using  the following keywords  \n- stored attributes will represent all attributes that are persistent in the persistence layer \n- Constant attributes have values initialised during instance creation and cannot be changed  \n-  propagated  attributes  represent  values  that  will  change  owing  to  a  problem  or  symptom  with \nrespect  to  the  entity  via  relationships  or  relationship  sets.  These  values  may  be  computed  and \npropagated based on external events.   \nBehavioural Model Attributes:- The Model  Manager will store all propagated attributes of an entity as a \nseparate data structure and will define methods to make it available to external interfaces   \nObject Model Attributes:-   The Model Manager will specify a data  structure that  would contain all \nthe  attributes  and  characteristics  of  the  entity.  The  Model  Manager  must  provide  the  necessary \ninterfaces  to  return only  the  object  model  based  on  queries.  The  Model  Manager  will  return  the \nattributes  of  the  object  model  as  a  name-value  pair  Building  Entities  and  Relationships  w.r.t  Network \nStandards:- The  Model  Manager  must  provide  frameworks  to  define  Entities  and  relationships  in \naccordance  with  the  industry  standards.    For  instance,  a  Cloud  applications  may  choose  to  create  the \nentities  and  relationships  based  on  TOSCA  standard  and  legacy  switches/routers  may  define  models \nbased on YANG/NETCONF standard  \nProvision  For  Dynamic  Modelling:-The  model  manager  must  provide  REST-based  interfaces  to  support  \nDynamic  Modelling  wherein  an  External  GUI  interface  can  create  topologies  on  the  fly  and  the  model \nmanager must be able to construct the entities and their relationships and form the object model   \n\nWeb-Based Interface:- The  model  Manager  must    make  available  REST  interfaces  to  query  the  Model \nEntities and relations for external web-based interfaces    \nDynamic Restart:-The model manager must be able to restart itself as a service when a model changes \ndynamically.  \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: For  me  the  learning  outcomes  are  so  many  like  some  of  them mentioned \nbelow:- - Learn  Professionalism - improved   communication   skills - developed   the  skills  of  time \nmanagement - learnt  various  new  languages  like  :- groovy,  tosca,  scala,  perl - working  experiences  of \nvarious cutting edge tools. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: This  company  dell  emc \nprovides ample amount of opportunities for new interns. they provide good projects for us and so much \nto learn from team and from project as well. All the teammates are very helpful. Overall work culture is \ngood  but  According  to  me  this  thing  does  not  depends  on  the  company  rather  I  will  say  it  will varies \nfrom manager  to  manager. They  provide  working  flexibilities  like  work  from  home. To  chill  there  are \nrecreational  places(24X7)  where  we  can  play  indoor  games  like  foosball,  pool,  billiards,  carrom,  chess, \ntable  tennis, etc. and also they provide  facility to play outdoor games like cricket, basketball,etc. Work \nthey  gave  me  is  as  per  my  expectation.   My  project  contribution  towards  the  product  which  is  an \nimprovement over the currently existing Dell EMC Corporation product SMARTS to provide broader use \nof Auto-Scaling Microservices, Database Persistence and Customisation to the end-user is to develop the \nwhole  independent  modelling  engine  component  from  scratch  only  using  the  glimpse  of  dependent \nmodel manager component from classic SMARTS. I learnt a lot from this practice school. Thank you PSD \nfor providing us this opportunity \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: COMPUTER NETWORKS, OOP, DSA, COMPILER \n \n "

Selenium  is  a testing \nframework which  can  be  used  to  write  functions,  such  that  given  the  right  parameters,  they  would \nperform small, but often repeated tasks like opening a URL, clicking a button, sending text, etc. On this \nframework,  we  have  a  program  developed,  which  is  uploaded  on  the  server  (thin  clients).  To  this \nprogram, we provide two files- a properties file, and a test cases file. It is these files that I have worked \non.  The  test  cases  file  is  in  a  comma-separated  values  format,  and  contains the  steps  to  be  performed \n(algorithm),  along  with  the  parameters- separately  for  each  test  case.  The  properties  file  is  a  text  file \nthat contains the values of the parameters supplied in the test cases file (URLs, text, element locations \netc.).  For  each  module,  a  separate  couple  of  properties  and  test  cases  files  must  be  prepared.  For \nmaking it user-friendly, I have created a UI for this, linking the back end with the front end. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Selenium (test framework), Eclipse, Chrome \nObjectives of the project: Automation of form filling and creating a UI \nOutcomes  of  the  project: With  form  filling  not  just  scripted,  but  also  user  friendly  (thanks  to  the  UI  I \ndeveloped),  employees  at  JDA  will  save  countless  hours  of  work,  and  focus  their  energies  on  more \npressing  demands.  I  did  not  know  JS  or  Selenium  before  coming  to  JDA,  but  having  used  them  in  a \nproject now, I think I have a better grasp of it. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Working  with  Selenium  Test  Framework,  Java,  Javascript  (Front  End  and \nBack End), Documentation \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: At  JDA,  the  working \nenvironment  is  nothing  short  of  awesome.  The  managers  are  good,  coworkers  are  nice  and  even  the \nsupport  staff  is  friendly- making  it  an  agreeable  workplace. The  projects  were  delivered  on  time, \nrelevant training was provided and the time limits were not very stringent. So even though I was new to \ntesting,  I  faced  no  difficulty  in  picking  things  up. On  the  very  first  day,  when  the  project  teams  were \nbeing  allotted,  I was  told  that  we  could  pick  up  any  project  we  wanted  according  to  our  convenience. \nThere is something for everyone at JDA, whether you are an aspiring web designer, tester, or even if you \nare good at documentation- JDA has relevant projects. I have seen people who did not even know a bit \nof  coding  come  here,  start  from  scratch,  complete  their  projects  and  get  PPOs.  Thus,  if  you  are \ninterested in testing, or a full stack designer who needs some practical experience to hone their skills, or \njust interested in getting an IT job, but are not much aware of the basics, JDA is the way to go. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: None \n "

				"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \n\nShort Summary of work done during PS-II: Market research is the process of assessing the viability of a \ngood  or  service  through  research conducted  directly  with  the  consumer  which  allows  a  company  to \ndiscover  the  target  market  and  record  analyst  opinions  and  other  input  from  consumers  regarding \ninterest  in  the  product.  Market  research  may  be  conducted  by  the  company  itself  or  by  a  third-party \ncompany  that  specializes  in  the  market  research  field.  The  PS  station  I  am  currently  associated  with, \nMordor  Intelligence,  belongs  to  the  latter  category.  Within  the  pyramid  of  market  research,  market \nmodelling,  building  an  intelligence  center,  analysing  the  strategies  of  leading  companies,  forms  the \nfoundation for all the other levels. The market research reports on food and beverage I am working on \ninvolves  understanding  the  drivers  and  restraints  for  a  specific  market,  segmenting  the  topic  and \nunderstanding the major companies operating in the region. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Intelligence Centers, Modelling Sheet, Market Estimation, \nMarket  Research,  Repots,  Top  Down  Approach,  Bottom  Up  Approach,  Logical  Guesstimation,  Analyst \nViews, MS- Excel (Advanced), CAGR, Primary Research, Secondary Research \nObjectives  of  the  project: Intelligence  Centers,  in  brief,  are  a  combination  of  building  comprehensive \ndata and analysis of this data which help us in forecasting the trends of industry. \nOutcomes  of  the  project: They  contain  exhaustive  data  which  helps  one  arrive  at  various  conclusions \nthus helping them in market related decision making. The flash reports emphasize on the understanding \nof  the  market  based  on  the  analysis  done  on  the  various  segments  in  the  market  and  the  major \ncompanies operating in the market. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: The scope of my current project includes an exhaustive modelling sheet with \n25-100 factors governing the final market value and analysis of the innumerable set of data available to \narrive  at  a  conclusion.  However,  the  project  is  limited  to  the  defined  scope  of  market  modelling  and \ndoes not include embedded analytics and statistical modelling which would take the project to the next \nlevel of the pyramid. Embedded analytics is the technology designed to make data analysis and business \nintelligence  more  accessible  by  all  kinds  of  application  or  user.  This  part  is  currently  being  handled  by \nthe technical team of the company, the foundation material for which is provided by the ICs. The flash \nreports include the understanding of the market through secondary and primary research and giving an \noverview about the drivers and restraints for the market and thus providing the client with the relevant \ninformation related to it. \n\nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Every  company  has  a \nunique  way  to  present  their  research  reports.  Mordor  Intelligence  reports  have  this  particular  style  as \nexplained in detail in this report. Due to this easy, simple and clear form of the  report, the company is \nmaking huge revenues and grew substantially high from its beginning.The work environment at Mordor \nIntelligence is an absolute bliss--working with people your age gives you a confidence boost and a sense \nof responsibility to take on bigger projects. \nAcademic  courses  relevant  to  the  project: Management  and  finace  courses,  in  addition  to  content \nwriting and digital media courses as it makes the majority of the work here at mordor, that is, analysing, \nexplaining and writing the  content. \n "

Non contiguous system memory support means, that the guest OS can \nbe  booted  with  any  number  of  DIMMs,  where  the  base  address  and  the  size  of  the  DIMM  can  be \nspecified  as  a  parameter.  Robustness  of  shell  scripts  involved  modularizing  all  the  scripts  and  adding \nsupport for hard failure in case of any command being failed while execution of script. Support of newer \nchips  involved  modifying  the  shell  scripts  involved  in  the  infrastructure,  which  basically  involved \nchanging  the  simulated  GPU,  VBIOS  and  chip  arguments.  Atomic  operations  support  on  infrastructure \ninvolved  making  the  read/write   operations  to  system  memory  word  separated,  instead  of  byte \nseparated  which  was  supported  earlier.  Bugs  solved  during  the  project  were,  updating  a  Perl  script  to \nconsider different remote machines until one live is found, issue in booting guest OS with two simulated \nGPUs, issue in loading Resource Manager on simulated GPU and launching guest OS (Win7 64 bit) on the \ninfrastructure.

I  worked  on  developing  an  efficient  crawler  system  in  Java,  using  Asynchronous \nHTTP clients and Jsoup libraries. Apart from writing parser codes for 67+ govt tender domains, fetching \n7000+ fresh tenders every day, I also worked on designing aspects of the core crawler framework and its \noptimizations.Besides, my job also included making front-end patches using Javascript React, and CSS3. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Technologies  used  were  primarily  back-end  related, \nincluding,  and  not  limited  to,  Java,  Spring-boot,  Maven,  Redis,  Jsoup,  Asynchronous  HTTP  clients  and \nSelenium  web  drivers.  Also  GitHub  was  used  extensively  for  code  collaboration  purposes,  and  the \nstandard Javadocs for the documentation part. \nObjectives  of  the  project: At  OFB,  the  objective  of  this  project  was  to  develop  an  efficient  crawler \nsystem  that  would  fetch  tender  data  and  information  from  the  govt.  websites,  and  then  serve  as  the \nback-end  database  for  company's  new  web  product  BidAssist.    BidAssist  is  a  new  generation  state-of-\nthe-art  Lead  Management  System  that  empowers  OFB's  new  businesses,  en  route  also  making  the \ncompany  India's  largest  non-govt,  non-profit tender  aggregator.   The objective was  to  crawl  tenders  in \nbulk,  with maximum  code  reusability,  and  reach  a  stable  target  mark  of  7000+  new  tenders  each  day. \nThe target has been duly met and the application tested thoroughly, making it virtually self-reliant  and \nwith the need of minimal maintenance. \nOutcomes of the project: The outcomes of the project were in accordance to the project objectives, and \nfall in line with the work summary as mentioned in above sections. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: There  were  tremendous  learning  outcomes  from  the  project  in  all the web \ndevelopment  technologies  as  mentioned  above.  Besides,  working  on  the  project,  we  also  got  greater \ninsights  into  the  concepts  of  networking  and  AI  as  these  were  the  cornerstones  of  BidAssist's  crawler \nframework. \n\nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: The working environment \nin  the  company  was  borderline  hostile.  The  office  doesn't  treat  interns  well  and  interns  are  often \noutcasted from all the company happenings. The behavioural etiquettes of the CTO are a sheer disgrace, \nand interns are often verbally and severely bashed for even company's own faults and mismanagement. \nDerogatory  remarks  on  one  intern  went  as  far  as  their  family  backgrounds  one  time.Besides  the \ncompany's   way   of  managing   things   is   largely   haphazard   and   utterly   unorganized, and   no   clear \nobjectives/targets are ever set. Forget appreciation, no acknowledgement of the work done by interns is \never made and company is always looking for cheap outsourcing of their work from students of, as they \nsay, lower tier colleges. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Information Retrieval \n(Natural Language Processing) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

The  app  has  its  frontend \nwritten  in  AngularJS  and  the  backend  written  in  Flask.  So,  I  had  to  learn  these  technologies  and  use \nthem to redesign the app. The second project involved redesign of the backend architecture which was \na  monolith  to  a  microservices  based  one.  This  involved  the  use  of  Docker  for  creating  containers  and \nKubernetes to be used as the orchestration platform for the docker containers.

Another project was - To \nanalyze data generated at qubole platform every day. Generated graphs which will \nbe sent to entire organization in form of report every morning via email which will be \nhelpful in deriving meaningful insights. One example of such graph is - distribution of \ntotal commands arcading to command type. it will help us understand which \ncommand type contributes more to the load. The various latencies graph will tell us \nwhich part is taking more time to run and hence corrective actions can be easily \ntaken. Another notebook has been written which keeps track of trends in last month \nwhich will tell us how customers are changing. Another major project was to retire \nDDJ tier from architecture. It saved millions of dollars for qubole. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Amazon aws, zeppelin, sql, \nlocust, postman \n \nObjectives of the project  : To understand qubole architecture in depth, \nbenchmark it, retire one module from it and do data analysis on generate data \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Amazon aws, Zeppelin notebook, python, ruby, java, \nhive-sql \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the \ncompany  : Work culture is very good. Interns directly get cutting edge projects. \nLarge proportion of employees are in their 20s. So very informal and friendly \n\n    \n \n  \n356|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \nmentors.

The mapper will be coded on a separate server which will act as an external api for sitestacks. The \nmapper has to be extensive and detailed in its response while maintaining a low latency. By introducing \nthis feature and a products page which will cater to the need for product vise data for users, we hope to \nmake sitestacks a very promising Siftery product. Another project was focused on increasing the quality \nof Siftery data and their Graph Universe. The retry logic was a sort of a look back mechanism where the \ndata from previous crawls were compared and any incoherent data found was recrawl to avoid any false \n\npositives. The  third  and  the  last project  dealt  with  reducing  the crawl  time  of  the  Company.  The \ncomplete  web  crawling  took  about  a  week  to  complete  and  the  project  objective  was  to  reduce  this \ntime. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Rails 5, PostgeSQL, Mongo DB \nObjectives  of  the  project: Working  on  the  web  crawl  architecture  of  the  company,  thereby  making  it \nefficient and fast. \nOutcomes of the project: As a result of the work done, the crawl time was reduced significantly and the \nGraph quality was enhanced. \nMajor Learning Outcomes: After the completion of my internship at Siftery, I can say without doubt that \nI  have  gone  on  to  become  a  better  programming,  a  team player  and  most  importantly  a  better \nprofessional. \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: PS  II  was  great  learning \nprocess for me. Working at Siftery was a great experience as we shared a lot responsibility and sense of \nownership in the area we started working. In the past  few months I have  pushed thousands of lines of \ncode into production and it feels amazing to see, the features I worked on being used by so many people \naround the world. At Siftery, they treat you like full time employees and give you a lot of responsibility \nfrom day 1. It's pretty challenging and at  same  time fun too. The start  up is one of the  fastest growing \ncompanies  in  India  and  I  would  recommend  tech  enthusiasts  to  definitely  consider  it  as  an  internship \noption. \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: OOP, DBMS, CP \n \n \n \n"

For  example,  in  a  general \nacademic  question, one  can  simply  name  a  variable  as  i,  j, k,  a,  b,  etc  but  while coding  for  a  company, \nevery bit matters. It is required to give proper names to all the  variables, so that when a peer who looks \nthrough it can understand the code  seamlessly. It is also quite  imperative   to have  proper indentation, \nproper  spacing  etc.  Also,  to  account  for  the  future  needs,  the  designed  code  should  be  as  simple  as  it \ncan be.

Based  on  TestNG,  a \ncommon unit testing framework, similar to Junit, but better in our use case, with the following features: \n1. Allows  Developers  to  group  tests  by  domain,  service  &  ability  to  execute  the  domain/service \ntests independently. \n2. Ability  to  define  priority  (Not  the  same  as  in  TestNG),  that  categorizes  the  tests  as  P1/P2/P3, \nenabling decisions when a component is ready to deploy or would need additional approvals. \n3. Custom    reports    generated,    that    would    cater    to    the    needs    of    different    audience \n(Executives/Managers/Developers) which are, of course, much better than the default TestNG report. \n*  ETL: I was give one ad-hoc task for data pulling, transformation and loading. Secondly, I modified the \nexisting ETL pipelines for better code hygiene, code coverage and removing existing potential bugs. \n* POC on database selection for search: I was given a task to pick a database which can perform well in \nwrites,  pointed  queries,  aggregations  and can  be  used  for  text  search.  The candidates  were  MongoDb, \nCassandra, ElasticSearch and Solr. I tested for the relative writes per second, response time for pointed \nqueries and simple aggregations. ElasticSearch came out on top and has a huge adoption rate nowadays. \nI developed related micro-service and corresponding mapping/indexing for accurate free text search. \nTools  used  (Development  tools - H/w,  S/w): Looper  (based  on  Jenkins),  Hygieia  (publishing  code \nresults), Sonar (for generating code hygiene reports), OneOps (cloud based VMs for deploying artifacts), \nintelliJ Idea, Atom and Eclipse for development, GitHub as VCS, OpenStack Swift for Object Store, Docker \nfor Containers and CCM for Central Configuration Management. \nObjectives of the project: The goal of smart forecasting project was to better forecast the sales of fast-\nmoving/perishable  items  to  avoid  over/under  stocking,  reduce  wastage  and  hence,  increase  revenue \ngeneration for Walmart US stores. \n\nOutcomes  of  the  project: Developed  micro-services  and  regression  tools  for  the  Smart  Forecasting \nproject. Learned better and cleaner coding in Java, React JS and Scala. Learned how search engines work \nand how to modify them for our own use. Developed a sense of punctuality and responsibility. Learned \nabout the understanding of actual scope of a production-based task. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Learned  about  open  source  search  Engines  based  on  Lucene,  mainly \nElasticSearch and Solr. Understood the importance and implemented Design principles. Mechanisms of \nRegression (End to end functional) testing. \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the company: Walmart GTS as a whole is \na  great  workplace  where  work-life  balance  is  a  priority  for  the  leadership.

TestNG  provides  a  framework  to  run  test  methods,  test \nclasses and test cases in parallelly.  \nI have written performance tests that covered 40+ scenarios  \n\nI  also  implemented  concepts  of  multithreading  that  led  to  80%  improvement  in  running  time  of  test \nsuites \nAcademic Domain: Software Testing \nTechnologies Learned:   \nTestNG, SQL , REST web services, Apache Ignite, IBM MQ \nTools used (Development tools - H/w,  S/w): HDFS, Informix,  TestNG, SQL , REST web services, Apache \nIgnite, IBM MQ, JDBC, Spring \nObjectives of the project: 1) Data archival in HADOOP 2) Performance test suites automation   \nOutcomes of the project: 1) Archived yearlong data of 1 million entries in HDFS \n2)  Wrote  performance  tests  that  covered  40+  scenarios  that  ensures  production  level  code  safety. \nImplemented multithreading that led to 80% improvement in running time of test suites \nMajor Learning Outcomes: 1) Bucketing and partitioning in HADOOP. \n2) OOP and OOAD concepts. \n3) MultiThreading \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: My  journey  at  Walmart \nstarted  with  very  little  knowledge  of  the  IT  industry.  I  had  taken  courses  in  Objected  oriented \nprogramming and Operating systems as part of disciplinary  electives. These courses  helped me  a lot  in \nunderstanding   various   other   concepts.   During   this   period   I   have   explored   topics   like   Database \nmanagement systems and Networking. I was fortunate enough to intern in a dynamic team where I was \ngiven  every  opportunity  to  learn  the  technologies  used.  I  was  given  sufficient  time  to  grasp  new \nconcepts.  The  team  was  receptive,  and  time  and  again  helped  me  in  all  the  challenges  I  faced.  All  the \ntrainees and new joinees in the GIF department were given daily sessions on what every component in \nGIF does. It was  during these sessions that  I was able to learn a lot  about the functioning of the entire \nGIF as a whole. It was amazing to witness how every team collaborates to fulfill orders to the customers \nkeeping the lowest price on the block• commitment. The exposure given has been great. I was the only \nintern   to   provide   production   support   during   the   Walmart   holiday   season.   My   experience   here \n@WalmartLabs has been amazing. It felt very engaging to work in the fortune one company. \n\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: OOP, OS, DSA, DBMS, Networking \n "

I  improved  the  Summariser  by  using  a  technique  called \nAided  Summarisation.  LexRank  Summarisation  technique  is  used  for  Extractive  summarisation  and  the \nsummary  is  enhanced  using  sentence  ranking  algorithm  based  on  title  matching  score  and  content \ndiversity score calculated by sentence  similarity algorithm. The sentence  similarity  algorithm is created \nusing gensim word2vec model. \nObject  Detection:- The  Object  detection  is  done  using  tensorflow  pre-trained  models  trained  on  the \nCOCO dataset that consists of 80 object categories. The videos are converted into a list of numpy arrays \nusing  the  moviepy  module.  Scene  detection  is  done  on  the  video  to  reduce  the  time  taken  by  the \ndetection algorithms and is performed using the ffmpeg library. The video is converted into a series  of \n\nsub- clips  that  can  be  loaded  into  memory.  The  detection  algorithms  are  run on  these sub-clips  and  at \nthe end they are concatenated using the moviepy library. \nFace Recognition:- The system architecture is divided into three processes-  Face Detection, Converting \nDetected  Faces  into  a  format  that  are  easily      comparable  to  the  faces  stored  into  the  dataset,  actual \nrecognition by similarity   calculation. Face Detection is done using MTCNN. Face Embeddings is created \nusing FaceNet. Embedding LookUp is done Clustering algorithm. \nTools used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Anaconda, Amazon Lambda, Amazon EC2 instance, Python, \nTensorflow, Keras \nObjectives of the project: Article Summarisation:-The GIstAI platform ,companys key product is a video \ncreation tool developed for news companies  to convert  their articles into news videos. The articles are \nfetched from their websites ,summarised and reduced to appropriate size for creation of videos without \nsignificant   loss  of   information.   The   summariser  was   not   working   properly   for   long articles   and \nsometimes  didnt  render  appropriate  results  and  needed  improvement.  Object  Detection:- Object \nDetection  is  quite  popular  in  the  industry  but  serving  good  models  as  an  API  to  clients  for  them  to \nupload videos and get object detections is where the problem starts. Face Recognition:- The objective is \nto develop a Largs Scale Facial Recognition System that is able to recognise identities efficiently from a \ndatabase pool of millions of faces. \nOutcomes of the project: Article Summarisation:- The system is live on the GISTAI Platform and is able \nto render good summaries. \nObject  Detection  :- The  object  detection  is  model  is  live  on  the  Google  Cloud  ML  Platform  and  is  able \ndetect objects out of 90 categories.  \nFace  Recognition:- The model is linearly scalable and is able to look up the database  and recognise  the \nfaces out of a pool of millions of faces.

Using  scikit-learn,  the  machine \nlearning  library  in  Python,  I  determined  the  dominant  parameters  affecting  the  profile  and  made  a \nregression model to predict the value of profile, given a set of input parameters. \nTools  used  (Development tools - H/w,  S/w): SQL; Python  (numpy,  pandas, matplotlib  and  seaborn  for \nconstructing plots, scikit-learn for machine learning);Microsoft Excel. \nObjectives  of  the  project: To  determine  the  dominant  parameters  affecting  the  profile  of  aluminium \nsheets. To make a regression model to predict the value of profile, given a set of input parameters. \nOutcomes of the project: Met the objectives. \nMajor  Learning  Outcomes: Statistical  analysis  of  an engineering  problem;  Procedure  to  follow  to \npresent data; SQL and Python programming \nBrief  Description  of  working  environment,  expectations  from  the  company: Very  supportive  work \nenvironment. Mentor is very  helpful and patient. Expected to get a project  working on the plant  floor, \nbut  got  a  multidisciplinary  project  topic  that  included  aspects  I  learnt  in  my  Mechanical  Engineering \ncourses  at  BITS  along  with  machine  learning  and  statistical  modelling  using  Python  programming. \nColleagues and staff are friendly and help in settling down in the beginning. Main drawbacks are that the \nplant is located in a remote location, especially for Bombay residents and the working hours are longer \nthan I would like (9-5:30 Mon-Fri and 9-1 on Sat). \nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Production Techniques I & II (the part related to rolling \nprocess).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

This was given to us because Amex is \nmoving towards Big Data Platform due to increase in customer base and the \nrequirement of processing huge amounts of data. Apart from this, I’ve also worked on \nautomating various complicated functionalities that are the proprietary tools used by \nAmex to analyse the behavior of a customer. I’ve also been assigned to create and \nmaintain various databases specific to different modelling teams depending on their \nneed and the model currently in use. Amex also gave me the flexibility to search for \nfunctionalities which were missing at the time that could make certain processes \neasier and gave me full freedom to work on it once the idea was discussed and \napproved. Works were diverted and divided among others so that I could implement \nit without any distractions. Working at Amex never felt like a challenge. The \nenvironment is amazing and the office is filled with amazing and sweet people who \nare always ready to help. I never felt like an Intern or an outsider there. I was always \nincluded in everything the used to do for fun and also in some of the meetings. I think \neach and everything that I’ve learnt in my PS-II, whether it be new technologies or \ncommunication and interpersonal skills, will prove useful to me in the future. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : PySpark, Hive, Java, SAS \n \nObjectives of the project  : The objective is to recreate various capabilities \nexisting in SAS platform in  Big Data Platform using PySpark \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Clear understanding of AMEX credit card services \nand card dynamics.

Two of them were steel structures, one Reinforced Concrete \nstructure and one composite structure. For all of these structures, I was the \nindependent structural engineer. I was responsible for delivering the structural design \nreport, structural drawings and fabrication drawings within the deadline. There were \ncertain challenges unique to each project and it was huge learning opportunity, \nworking on each of them. The steel structure had a Steel truss for it's roof and \nprocess of the design of the truss was a brilliant space to give way to your innovation \nand creativity as an engineer. The composite structure was an entirely new concept \nhaving steel members and an in-casing of RCC. The concrete structure, though only \na G+2 structure, was located in Earthquake zone V, for which extensive dynamic \ncomputations had to be performed using response spectrum analysis, incorporating \nthe effect of vertical ground motion.

Which means that they continuously assign you projects, of \nwhich you are the independent structural engineer and along with an architect, you \nhave to complete the design and the drawings within the deadline. But the work \nculture is below average to say the least. Medium of conversation is majorly Marathi, \nyou have to work 6 days a week and with the deadlines closing in, you'll have to stay \nback as long as it takes. So, I have had to sit through two hour long conferences, \nstaring blankly at faces because everyone was speaking in Marathi. But again, the \nVP of the department is an absolute genius and the smallest of the discussions that I \ncould have with him (because he stays occupied mostly), were very enlightening(with \nrespect to structural engineering).

Securities lending or stock \nlending refers to  the  lending  of securities by  one  party  to another. The  terms  of  \nthe  loan  will  be  governed  by  a  \"Securities  Lending  Agreement which requires \nthat the borrower provides the lender with collateral, in the form of cash or non-cash \nsecurities, of value equal to or greater than the loaned securities plus agreed upon \nmargin. Key lenders of securities include mutual funds, insurance companies, \npension plans and other large investment portfolios. Most securities loans are \ncollateralized, either with other securities or with cash deposits. Where lenders take \nsecurities as collateral, they are paid a fee by the borrower. By contrast, where they \nare given cash as collateral, they pay the borrower interest but at a rate (the rebate \nrate) that is lower than market rates, so that they can reinvest the cash and make a \nreturn. Pricing is negotiated between the parties and would typically take into account \nfactors such as supply and demand for the particular securities, collateral flexibility, \nthe size of any manufactured dividend and the likelihood of the lender recalling the \nsecurities early. As well as securities lending, sale and repurchase (repo) and buy-\nsell back transactions are  used  for  the  temporary  transfer  of  securities  against  \ncash. My key responsibilities include: Monitoring  PB  Short  Sales  and  Short  \nInterest  to  assist  traders  in  devising  and optimizing trading strategies. Run \nvarious analytical process over varied securities and markets to identify possible \nShort Squeezes and hence inform the traders regarding the same. Inventory \noptimization to reduce borrowing cost by flipping the inventory internally across  \nvarious  available  books  and  desk  against  borrowing  it  from  the  street  and \nhence directly improving the PnL for the team. Analyzing and identifying the \nrefinancing opportunity on various securities and hence reducing  the  borrowing  \ncost  by  informing  the  traders  of  the  same  and  thus  asking them to modify the \ntrades. Generating commentary on various markets to give overview of market \nmovements, top  securities,  market  movers  across  sectors  in  different  regions  \nnamely  APAC, EMEA and Americas. Generating   Analytical   reports   on   current   \ninventory,   current   fee   structure   and loan/borrow trade values on a client basis/ \nentity basis to give overview as to where the business is moving.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Excel, Tableau \n \nObjectives of the project  : 1. Forecasting of Stock loan( Shorts Pnl) and Debit \nPnl on the basis of internal and external factors. 2.

Apart \nfrom understanding excel, I learnt about Tableau application. I got to know about the \nfunctioning of Stock loan business, short selling and short squeeze. I also  learnt \nabout trade life cycle, different types of securities lending transaction, securities \nclassification, quantification of risk.  \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the \n\n    \n \n  \n87|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \ncompany  : Working environment depends on the team.

After the 2008 financial crisis, BASEL committee of \nBanking devised the framework for the In-house assessment of the processes and it \nwas made compulsory for he firms to conduct in-house assessment for their process. \nThis assessment are shared with the regulators quarterly and are reviewed by the \nsenior managers/Chief Operating Officers (COOs) in different frequency intervals in \nthe forums like BRCMs(Business risk controls meetings) and GMCC (Global Market \nControl Committee). The projects in GM Controls revolve around the Reporting tools \nand Dashboards to ensure the business is compliant and also informed of the errors \noccurring during the duration of assessment. The Key Risk Indicators (KRI) have \nbeen defined on the basis of the process to monitor the risk occurring due to People, \nProcess or System.  These KRI are also called Metrics for daily Processing. In \nGovernance & Reporting, These KRI’s are reported in various platforms depending \non the Risk of the Business. The details of few key projects are as follow: \n1) Governance MI – A group of 36 metrics have been determined and agreed by the \nbusinesses to reflect the Operation Risk of the Business. These metrics are divided \ninto 4 different pillars- Conduct, Operations, Behaviour and Control Environment. \nGovernance MI is reported monthly. The data for this MI is sourced from various \nsources. It is then analysed and Reconciled into a dashboard which give a complete \nview of the Metrics for particular Business for the Month of analysis. This MI is \nreflected in all the Business specific BRCMs and the group level GMCC. Governance \nMI gives the Month-on-Month view for the metrics and the RAG status for the same, \nRe for the Breach, Amber for nearing Breach and Green for being in control. These \nRAG is determined based on pre-defined thresholds which are changed half Yearly \non 12 months moving average. \n \n2) APAC DASHBOARD – It is a group specific dashboard where all the Metrics \nassociated with the Asia Pacific group are reported in single window. This is an \nextensive dashboard consisting of 142 BRCM Metrics and 111 ORCC metrics. This \ngives a trend view for all the metrics for all the APAC business, being able to view \nthree months view in the dashboard. Also giving the RAG for the metrics similar to \nGovernance MI.  \n \n3) BRCMs and GMCC  – The performance of a business is analysed and monitored \nmonthly, and discussed in these monthly meetings. These Business Risk Controls \nmeetings are organised by the Business COOs to discuss business performance. All \nthe aspects of business are discussed in these meetings to insure that the business \nis running smooth, and to rectify all misdoings that has happened/ might occur. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Microsoft Excel \n \nObjectives of the project  : Monthly assessment and Report generation for \nBusiness Operation Risk \n\n    \n \n  \n94|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Networking is very important and Importance of \nOperation Risk \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Quality Control Assurance & \nReliability \n "

				"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \n \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II : I competed 3 major assignments \nand also handled BAU tasks of the team.  \nThe objective of the first assignment was to automate the Divisional and Legal Entity \nsplit of Potential Exposure (PE) Impact due to Overrides. (The overrides are a list of \ncomplex trades of certain counter-parties whose exposure profiles through the usual \ncalculation procedure do not reflect the true economic value; hence manual \ncalculation is done). This is achieved by splitting the PE by taking into consideration \nthe Mark to Market (MtM) and Standardised Approach - Counterparty Credit Risk \n(SA-CCR) Potential Future Exposure (PFE) numbers. The business outcome of this \nassignment was that it saved around 6 business hours monthly. Also the control \nchecks put in place ensured that operational errors are registered and rectified.  \n \nThe second assignment involved automating the exposure calculation process \ninvolved in maintaining a specific override. The process involved calculation of \nExposure Exposure (EE) and Potential Exposure (PE) by the shortcut formula. It also \ninvolves Calibration of Inflation, Interest Rate and Mortality Rate for PE and EE VaR \ncalculation which is used in PE and EE calculation. Additionally sourcing of Inflation \nand Interest Rate sensitivities for PE and EE VaR calculation was also done.  \n \nThe third assignment involved building a tool for control check of PE and EE profiles \nfor Overrides. It basically compares the PE and EE profiles of the overridden \ncounterparties of two environments to register any mismatch and to ensure whether \nthey are due to overriding of profiles by override owner or due to improper flow of PE \nand EE profiles. \nprofile. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Excel, VBA, SQL, Internal \nSoftware's/Applications. \n \nObjectives of the project  : Exposure Calculation Methodology \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : The BAU of my team was to generate Potential \nExposure, PE and Expected Exposure, EE numbers, both unstressed and stressed \nfor the front office (FO). This enhanced my knowledge of trades (Swaps, Options, \nForwards, Swaptions, Caps/Floors).

I was treated as an integral part of the team and \nincluded in the BAU tasks and other assignments of the team.  \n \nIt gives you a feel of the corporate world and culture which I can assure you is very \ndifferent from what we are accustomed to, in our college. Also interacting with \nseniors of the team, especially senior BITSians, helps a lot in understanding how to \nhandle this change and not be overwhelmed by it. \nThere were guest lectures for us interns by experienced bankers in Credit Suisse in \nhigh positions from across the globe which were very inspiring and enlightening. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Basic knowledge of Finance like \nDerivatives, Risks which are covered in DRM and FRAM respectively. \n "

				"writeUp": " \nStudent Write-up \n \nShort Summary of work done during PS-II : It seems only last week I was \ncollecting my ID from Goldman Sachs and now PS-2 has come to an end. These \npast 5 months have flown by and I will not forget the lessons I learnt here. I interned \nin the Operations Division of the firm, in the Securitized Products Services team. In \nthe beginning, I was unsure about how to carry myself in a corporate environment, \nthat too in a corporate giant such as Goldman Sachs. The first few weeks I spent \nobserving carefully my team, how they carry themselves and commit to their work. It \ndidn’t take as long as I expected to blend into the corporate environment. The \nGoldman experience helped me understand how the corporate world looks and \nworks like.  \nIt helped me apply my technical knowledge to practical scenarios, transitioning from \nlearning in college to application in the firm. This was my first internship where my \n\n    \n \n  \n152|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \nwork had an important role to play in the day-to-day performance of the team. The \nlearning curve for the first few weeks was very steep and I was trained on the day to \nday function of the team. I had to make sure that all the legal documents needed for \na trade to happen are in on time and they have been approved by the reviewing \nteams. I also had to ensure that all the trades are executed on time according to \ndifferent deadlines of different markets and correctly. In addition I had to make \njournal entries for different invoices. Then I started working on my project in addition \nto day-to-day functions. That helped me learn about how the trader commission \naccount is maintained and how we maintain a journal of different transactions. There \nwere no special skills required to the job except for a very basic know-how of Excel. \nHowever, it is pretty helpful to do a few finance courses as it just improves the \nunderstanding of what the team is doing and how it relates to the industry as a whole. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Excel, Visual Basic for \nApplications, SQL \n \nObjectives of the project  : To find and understand the breaks in trader \ncommission account, caused by incorrect timing or amount of debit/ credit and create \nan automated tracker that identifies the breaks, reconciles all the reports and help \nresolve that break which will save a lot of time of team which can be utilized for other \ncritical tasks. It aims to improve efficiency and save time. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : I gained a significant amount of knowledge \nregarding the international market and trading world from my team.  \nThe project gave an insight of how the trader commission account works and how the \nsettlements are done and how the data flows from different systems. It also gave me \nan in-depth knowledge of how books and records are maintained, how the breaks are \ncaptured and resolved and how an automated tracker is created. \nI also learnt about data warehousing, data visualisation and analytical reporting tools \nthrough Data School sessions conducted by Goldman Sachs. My knowledge and \ninterest in the financial sector has risen along with the development of soft-skills that \nare essential in the modern office space. I also learnt how to manage my time and \nplan ahead to meet deadlines.  \n \nBrief Description of working environment, expectations from the \ncompany  : I have observed how my team covers for others when someone is on \nleave, which reinforces the importance of teamwork in the success of any \norganization. The essentialism displayed by my team when it comes to \ncommunication as well as handling issues is surely something which I have imbibed \nduring the course of my internship. Also, the humility displayed by the Vice \nPresidents and Group Leaders has left a deep impact on me. I look up to these \npeople and strive to achieve excellence in every walk of life.

This project requires a deep understanding \nof certificate management and machine learning algorithms.  \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, \nJasmine, Gulp, Java, Weka \n \nObjectives of the project  : Security Test Automation & Risk Assessment of \nX.509 Certificates \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Learned a lot about how enterprise level code is \nwritten, the production pipeline followed while building a software. I also got to learn a \nlot about cloud computing, how technologies like Docker and Kubernetes are used \nand how powerful they can be. \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Machine Learning, Data Mining, \nCloud Computing \n "

AI OpenScale allows \nbusinesses to operate and automate AI at scale – irrespective of how the AI was built \nand where it runs. This service provides enterprises visibility into how AI is built, \nused, and performs thus proving to be a major breakthrough in the field of Machine \nLearning by serving as the solution for the issues of \"explainability, bias detection, \nand remediation\". I was initially assigned the work of verification of some of the \nfeatures and regression testing to get comfortable with the already existing code and \nfeatures. The work included testing whether a variety of datasets comprised of varied \ndata types, were biased or unbiased using the data bias calculation service, testing a \nvariety of models such as SVM, Tensorflow, Keras on top of Tensorflow built using \nframeworks such as Scikit-Learn, using the model the model bias calculation service.  \nThen I was assigned to work on implementing logging across all the functions using a \ncustom logger which had to store additional information apart from logging the \nerrors/warnings. I was assigned the task of improving the service's performance by \nmaking use of a local cache. Later, I worked on implementing RESTful API for \ncommunication across the sub-services.

API’s have been developed for 3 such use \ncases. The first use case includes the Proof of Existence which is an API designed to \nprove the existence of a document or a string in a private blockchain so as to prove \nthe rightful ownership of the document based on a timestamp and block number. The \nsecond use case deals with the telecom industry by preventing the usage of stolen \nphones by making sure they cannot register to mobile network  \nproviders. The third use case can be used to solve the common fraud found in the \nfinance industry which involves invoice financing. Various technologies and \ndatabases have been used which are listed below. \n \nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w)  : Docker, MongoDB, Ethereum, \nMySQL, Truffle, Ganache, Android Studio, Expo \n \nObjectives of the project  : Proving the existence of data at a certain point in \ntime can be very useful for  educators, entrepreneurs, and attorneys. Timestamping \ndata in an unalterable state  while maintaining confidentiality is perfect for legal \napplications. The Proof of  Existence project is based on the concept about proving \nthe ownership of a certain  document/file/media which was created on a date and \ntime. The Proof of Existence API allows the  users to store the hash of data securely \nwithin the Ethereum Blockchain so that in  future no claims can be raised regarding \nthe ownership of the data. The second API is the Prevention of theft.The Prevention \nof Theft platform aims at bringing all Telecom Companies and  other authorities such \nas Police Department into a consortium, so that the IMEI  blacklist can be shared \n\n    \n \n  \n435|P a g e  BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus \n  \namong them. This means that an IMEI number blocked by  one member of the \nconsortium will be considered blocked by every other parties  under the network. This \nis implemented using Blockchain Technology (Ethereum  Platform) using the concept \nof ‘Proof of Existence’. This API aims at preventing the usage of stolen phones by \nmaking sure it cannot be  registered to any network provider or even if they do try to \nregister with a stolen  phone, the location of the phone is found. The 3rd API is the \ntrade finance API which is used to prevent fraud in invoice financing. \n \nMajor Learning Outcomes : Learnt Blockchain concepts, Server side coding, \nDatabase Management, UI development, Team work, Communication \n \nAcademic courses relevant to the project : Computer Programming \n "

In our first project,\nwe first tried finding defocus map using basic image processing techniques such as edge\n41\n\ndetection using Sobel operator and Laplacian operator continued with some advanced image\nprocessing techniques such as canny edge detector. Since plain edge detection techniques are\nnot giving good results, we turned to machine learning models such as holistic edge detector.\nEdge detectors are giving good results when the defocused part of the image has very less\nvariation in intensities. As we know that this will not be the case for every image, we want to find\ndefocus map by finding the function/ kernel that is causing the defocus. And also, we are using\nsome deep learning models ( advanced models of CNNs) to find the defocus map. For the\nsecond project, we built a crop tool that automatically crops an image with the user given aspect\nratio while maintaining the image composition and aesthetics. We combined a neural network\narchitecture and an optimisation module to maintain the image composition and aesthetics. This\ntool is designed to combine with export workflow of LrClassic so that it would significantly\ndecrease the time spent by user while exporting batches of images\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : Jupyter Notebook, Lightroom, SQLite,Plotly\nObjectives of the project : Object Homogeneous Defocus Map Estimation and Automatic Crop\nfor Export Workflow\nMajor Learning Outcomes : I had to explore different architectures for the model to recognize\nthe region of interest and experiment on it.

These prototypes were built in a way such that sub-\nassemblies   can   be   varied   for   producing   desirable   Damping   force   in   the   damper   (Shock\nabsorber). Piston sub-assembly is one of such sub-assemblies. In Piston sub-assembly, valve\nstacks will be located on both sides.

My project is based on the simulation of wagon components using\nz-Cast Pro software in steel foundry at Belgharia plant of Texmaco Ltd. My project deals with\nsimulation of the actual casting process of products produced by Texmaco through casting. I\ndiscuss the casting of two of their major components, traction link and yoke. The first part of the\nproject involves performing trial simulations on different components shared by WILP, BITS\nPilani.  Followed  by a simulation of a traction link model shared by Texmaco. After that,\ndesigning 3-D models of yoke casting set-up and performing simulation through Z-Cast Pro to\nget detailed analysis of the casting process. We match the simulation results with the results of\na real process to find a cause of the defects that arise in the casting and to propose a solution to\nreduce the defects if possible.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Z-Cast Pro software, it is casting simulation\nsoftware for new method Computer Aided Simulation (Z cast pro software). In this software, we\ncan check the design by simulation.\nObjectives of the project:  To  analyze   and  check  for  defects  in  wagon   components  by\nperforming casting simulation using Z-Cast Pro software.\n575\n\nMajor learning outcomes: I learnt about the importance of casting simulation in the field of\nmanufacturing where customer satisfaction is our ultimate aim. Texmaco earlier invested a lot in\nshop-floor trials which led to increase in cost per production of wagon components. Now after\nsimulation, we can simulate the wagon components to know the amount of defects in our\ncastings. This will help in reducing the number of shop-floor trials thus reducing the costs on\nrepairs.\nDetails of papers / patents: Nil\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: My internship\nat Texmaco was WFH where my job was to simulate the casting models to look for defects and\npropose a solution to reduce the defects. I was allotted Texmaco Ltd., where my project was to\nanalyse the casting models shared by Texmaco using z-Cast Pro software, my internship\nstarted where I was shared some practice problems by WILP BITS Pilani that I did and gained\nsufficient knowledge regarding z-Cast Pro software which is comparatively a new software. Post\nthat they shared with me the combined model of traction link on which I performed the\nsolidification analysis to check for defects. I was then asked to design a 3-D model yoke casting\nset-up and simulate to check for defects, my mentor was supportive throughout my internship\nand provided me with all the details required to work on my project. Working with Texmaco\nhelped me in understanding the working of the company and how small changes can help in\nbringing better goods for the company. We had regular meets through G-meet where we\nanalysed and discussed the simulation results, the environment was friendly and supportive.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Production techniques I, Machine design and\ndrawing."

I was supposed to coordinate between the two for\n406\n\nefficient completion of my main project. I was responsible for giving them key market insights to\ndrive sales in the entire Delhi region allotted to me. I was also allotted side projects in the supply\nteam in both teams.\nThe main project was to do the market sizing for the F&V industry in Delhi. It was to gauge the\npotential reach of Udaan Fresh and suggest initiatives to get into the serving the extremely\nwidespread F&V industry in Delhi NCR. It was important to understand how much potential each\npincode had along with understanding what kind of SKU would be ideal for each pincode. We\nused Statistical tools to get an unbiased view of the same. Apart from this, we did various side\nprojects and got an overview into the entire process behind the supply side and demand side of\nthis vertical and were able to learn various technical and soft skills to help us in our professional\ncareer post college.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w) : SQL, Python, Excel\nObjectives of the project : An estimation of Purchasing Power of F&V category among various\ndivisions of Delhi buyers was to be done, considering the following factors: - 1.

As interns,\nhowever, the involvement in the day to day activities wasn't there and we weren't involved a lot\nin the team due to us having a separate project, which did not really affect the day to day\nfunctioning of the vertical. We had weekly meetings. The HR for the few of us in Delhi office was\nbased in Bangalore only so it has operational challenges. But, since next semester onwards,\nUdaan Delhi is a separate PS station, this won't be a problem anymore. Not everybody had a\nseparate  project  to   be  done.  Those   who   were   given  projects  in  their   team's   day   to  day\nfunctioning enjoyed their stint. However, they did feel that the work was a bit monotonous.\n407\n\nOverall, it was a good insight into the working of a B2B E-commerce company and helped one\nunderstand the nuances of this sector.

Initially, a background study on solenoid\nvalve was done regarding their working principles, types, approvals and applications. Since, the\nvalve was to be used in sea water, which leads to pitting and crevice corrosion, an extensive\nstudy on materials used for making seals, housing and springs was also done to suggest a\nbetter alternative material. This included a detailed study on stainless steel covering points like\ntypes of SS, types of corrosion in SS and criteria for selection of different grades of SS. After\nfinalizing the material for the valve, and having gained significant knowledge about the working\nof the valve, the next step was designing. For this, a benchmarking study was done based on\nASCO premium products followed by a study of competitor products. The takeaways from these\nstudies were used to develop numerous design proposals. Finally, by using a Pugh matrix, the\ndifferent   proposals   were   compared   and   ranked   based   on   different   factors   such   as   cost\neffectiveness, ease of assembly, manufacturability etc. and the best one was finalized for\nproduction.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): PTC Creo, MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint.\nObjectives of the project: Design of 3/2 way solenoid valve for sea water application (direct\nacting and dry construction).\nMajor learning outcomes: Got to know about the process of product development in the core\nindustry.

Metrics provide objective measures of performance, and this data enables us to transform\nboth the customer requirements as well as operational performance to numbers which can be\ncompared.  As  part  of   this  project,   I  have  understood  call  logs   for  bug  detection  and  to\nunderstand the propagation of various messages and events during the call. I have worked on\ndeveloping and testing a functionality for load testing of various capacity metrics sent by all\ncomponents to service called metricmgr. This helped in understanding the CPU load and the\nthreshold rate of sending metrics that a pod in the cluster can handle before it crashes. I have\nalso worked on adding a new functionality to send various SIP call leg stats for different end\npoints to Prometheus pod.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): I have used Python scripts for implementing my\nproject. Other technologies involve Prometheus, Google Protocol Buffers, AWS, Kubernetes,\nNew Relic.\nObjectives of the project: The main objective of implementing load testing of metrics is to\nunderstand the CPU load and the threshold rate of sending metrics that a pod in the cluster can\nhandle before it crashes. And current implementation only supports capacity metrics.\nMajor learning outcomes: This internship provided me hands on experience in using and\ndeveloping with Kubernetes. It also helped me understand about cloud computing platform like\nAWS. I came to know about several protocols and strategies while understanding the Sequin\narchitecture. Various setups and tasks helped me use several tools like JIRA, Atlassian Git,\nNew Relic, Minikube, Docker etc. I have also gained insights into writing quality code that meets\nthe industry standards. This opportunity has introduced me to various tools like New Relic,\nPrometheus etc., and several other new concepts which helped me to greatly enhance my\nlearning experience. Various group discussions, seminars which are part of Practice School\nhave improved my communication skills and confidence levels.

You also have to work at late hours as well because of\nthe nature of the work. At times, the work does become monotonous, and then you are\nexpected to not lose motivation and still deliver quality work.

There was a need to extract only the required data from this source\nsheet along with the other data (that is from a different source) parallely and update them into a\ndefined structure of data every time. So, a python script was created to do so. For that purpose,\nsome basic python related to / involving data analysis was required.

Then, queries are written using aggregate\npipeline in Mongo compass, and the desired code for the flask app is taken. The aggregation\npipeline is a framework for data aggregation modeled on the concept of data processing\npipelines.   Documents   enter   a   multi-stage   pipeline   that   transforms   the   documents   into\naggregated results. Then, APIs are created in the flask framework using those previously written\nqueries and then tested in Postman. API testing is used to determine whether the output is well-\nstructured and useful to another application or not, checks the response on basis of input\n(request) parameter, and checks how much time the API is taking to retrieve and authorize the\ndata too. In this way, we finally get the working APIs which can directly be used in Angular using\nHTTP requests. Here, while working with the APIs, it's the choice of the developer either to write\nless APIs and take most of the desired data (this way will require more operations in the\nfrontend to filter the data) or to write a greater number of APIs and take specific data (in this\ncase, developer don’t need to make many efforts in frontend). Now, we use the APIs developed\nin backend using HTTP requests and perform several operations on data as per need. As\nscreen requirements are shared with us before development, we first identify the materials used\n262\n\nand then write logic for each section. We used “Angular Materials” for all the statements to\nmaintain   consistency   and   better   configuration   options.

Nuclear heat generated in the\nreactor core due to fission is extracted using liquid sodium as coolant. FBTR is loop type\nreactor, which has two primary loops to exchange the heat to secondary sodium system.\nFurther, heat in secondary sodium system is transferred to steam water system to generate\nelectricity. The heat generated inside the core is distributed equally to two primary loops. Each\nloop has a heat exchanger and sodium pump. After exchanging the heat to secondary sodium in\nthe heat exchangers in each loop sodium in both the loops is passed through a common inlet\npipe into the reactor vessel. Over flow tank collects the excess sodium in reactor vessel, and\nthrough EM pump part of the sodium is passed through a sodium purification circuit. Sodium\nreturn to reactor vessel after purification. Over flow tank plays important role in the maintenance\nof sodium level in RV. The decrease in sodium level in OFT is one of the indirect indications of\nleak in primary sodium loop. Hence, OFT sodium level discordance alarm is provided in main\ncontrol room to alert the operator, in case of change in the level of OFT. Presently, the alarm\nset-point is manually set by the operator in control station after OFT level stabilizes. However,\nOFT   also   changes   during   normal   process.   Since,   the   capacities   of   primary   loops   are\ninterconnected, with increase in sodium temperature, sodium volume also increases and hence\nthe level in various capacities and hence, it reflects an increase in sodium level in OFT. So, the\noperator has to frequently change or set the discordance alarm threshold during genuine\nprocess changes. Due to which it may happen that alarm due to actual leak may get masked\nduring process transients. Hence, it is required to have automatic set-point tracker to ensure\nthat set-point is automatically “tracked” following the OFT level in case of genuine process\nchanges. The project is to design and develop an automatic set-point tracker, which includes\nsignal conditioning of temperature signal, analyzing of data (sodium level vs temperature) and\nderiving relationship between the changes in OFT sodium level and changes in temperature and\nsuitably changing the set-point.\n280\n\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Python3, MATLAB.\nObjectives of the project: Automatic OFT level discordance setpoint tracker.\nMajor   learning   outcomes:   Got   experience   in   real   world   problems,   apply   knowledge   in\nindustrial process.\nDetails of papers / patents: Nil\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Work from\nhome environment.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: None"

It is mainly the\ndevelopment of a forwarding architecture that acts as a middle-ware between panels uploading\nimages and the data lake. The entire architecture consists of multiple micro-services, servers\nand   storages   that   communicate   and   exchange   information   between   one   another.   One\nautomated service periodically retrieves images from remote cameras and forward to a central\nserver that handles storage and retrieval of images from MongoDB and Minio object store.\nAnother server / service utilizes the image-store server to retrieve images and generate a\ntimelapse based on parameters given to it. This is done automatically and periodically for all\ncameras, as well as on-demand basis. It was my task, along with another PS2 intern, under the\nguidance of project mentors to setup the entire architecture and make it scalable and efficient\nfor future improvements and addition of microservices.

My work was focused on Anomaly detection in time-series, images,\nand video databases and creating a privacy-preserving distributed architecture to implement\nthese frameworks. I worked with three other people on this project (2 of them were research\nscientist and one Ph.D. Intern). The project covered ML, DL, Federated learning, Computer\nvision, Time-series analysis, and IoT. When writing this on 21/12/2020, we (me and my team)\nhave submitted two patents and almost completed work for two publications. I am a CS student;\nthat's why I was given this project, but if you are a EEE/ENI/ECE student, there is very little\nchance of getting the work that focuses on ML/DL. Most of the CS student (I think there were a\ntotal of 6-7 CS student) were given project based on ML/DL/CV/ Auto-ML/ GAN based projects,\nwhereas EEE/ENI/ECC (there were around 20-25) were given mostly IC verification/Silicon /\nSOC blah blah kind of work. Most of the people who were with me in Intel Labs had to work for\n12-13 hours a day. Nobody will ask you to spend this much time, but most of the Research\nScientist do these kinds of hours, so they will have similar expectations from you, although I\nmust say that it has been worth it for me, not sure about others. Your work will be heavily\ndependent on your team; my mentor was incredibly supportive, not the case with few others.\nEven though most CS students had a great project, not everyone has a very supportive mentor,\nso make a decision keeping this in mind.

Some additional work involved -\nexploring the Quarkus framework as an alternative to the Spring framework and comparing the\ntwo in terms of memory footprint, boot times etc.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Java, SQL, Spring, Quarkus, Maven, Docker,\nKubernetes, Go, Terraform, Linux, Git, IntelliJ, SQL developer.\nObjectives of the project: Improve cloud application security.\nMajor learning outcomes: Cloud application development and software development, Object\noriented design patterns, Micro-service architecture and RESTful API design.\nDetails of papers / patents: N/A\n467\n\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: Well structured\nguidance is given to the interns. We were enrolled in a week long boot-camp at the start of the\ninternship that helped refresh the basics of Java and SQL, followed by some new tools like\nContext & Dependency Injection (CDI) frameworks like Spring. All other required tools are\nproject specific and ample time is given to go through its documentation before using it.\nThroughout the internship, every Friday, we had an 'Intern Assembly' where we were addressed\nby senior members, from different teams, sharing their experience about working at oracle along\nwith   a   technical   presentation   about   their   teams.   Overall,   Oracle   is   an   employee   friendly\ncompany with space for new ideas in every team.\nAcademic   courses   relevant   to   the   project:   Object   oriented   programming,   Database\nmanagement system, Computer networks, Operating system, Data structure and algorithms,\nCryptography."

				"writeUp": "Student write-up\nShort summary of work done during PS-II: I worked with the data science team, CX unity at\nOracle, Bangalore. The team was formed in 2019. The work is very good but can be a bit hectic.\nEach team member is loaded with multiple things and there is a lot to learn. The work involved\ndata engineering and data science. The first project covered APU test automation using Karate\nframework. This was an independent project and I was able to complete it within a month. This\nproject gave me an in-depth understanding of the data science pipeline used. Next, I worked on\nthe Next Best Offer (NBO) models. As a part of NBO, I did discovery and research on product\nrecommenders and ultimately built four recommender models. These models were integrated\ninto the framework and subsequently went into production after few modifications. I then started\nworking on propensity models that is predicting whether a customer will take a certain action or\nnot. Lastly, I worked on smoke suite tests with the vision of an end to end testing framework for\nthe data science platform. The team is highly experienced  and each team member was\nextremely supportive and helpful. The manager was very friendly and she showed confidence in\nme for many crucial projects and tasks.\n468\n\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Karate framework, Data science models (SVD,\nRandom forest, LightGBM, Hybrid recommender).\nObjectives of the project:  API   test   automation:  Automating  the  data science   API   calls,\nverifying the functionality for each call, and generating a report for the same. Next Best Offer:\nGiven   the   customer   data,   web   events,   and   product   information,   build   a   recommender\nframework.\nMajor   Learning   Outcomes:   I   developed   an   understanding   of   test   automation   and   how\nimportant it is for all teams and all companies. Manual testing can be really cumbersome and\nhence each team focuses on automating it. I also learnt customizing different data science\nmodels according to different customer needs. There were many different beautiful data science\nconcepts that I learnt while researching and developing models. One more important thing is\nthat Oracle is not a database company any more. It is shifting rapidly towards the cloud, AI,\ncustomer intelligence etc.\nDetails of papers / patents: NA\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: The work\nculture  depends  on  the  team.  There  are  a  large  number of   teams  and  the work  would\ncompletely depend on the team. But everyone is really supportive and even if you need help\nfrom a person outside the team, then that person would be more than willing to help you. There\nare regular intern assemblies to get interns acquainted with different business verticals. As far\nas my team is concerned, my manager was really very friendly. She always took out time to give\nme one on one feedback and appreciate my work. She always considered me as a team\nmember rather than an intern. I was assigned a mentor who helped me with the setup, gave me\na product overview, and ensured I am comfortable with the projects allocated. I had interactions\nwith the entire team (most of them were data scientists) and each of them was supportive and\nhelpful.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Data science courses to develop a fundamental\nunderstanding of data science.\n469\n"

				"writeUp": "Student write-up\nShort summary of work done during PS-II: I worked as a front-end web development intern,\nwith focus on EMR (Electronic Medical Records), the interface primarily used by healthcare\nprofessionals.   Throughout   the   internship,   I   was   part   of   a   team   that   worked   in   an   Agile\ndevelopment cycle following the Scrum methodology. I had the opportunity to develop and work\non features of a consult helper that would assist doctors in consulting with their patients. Apart\nfrom this, I also worked on tasks pertaining to other projects and resolving bugs / issues as and\nwhen required. The technologies used involved PHP (with Laravel framework), HTML, CSS and\nJavaScript.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP (with Laravel\nframework), Git Cola, Bitbucket.\nObjectives of the project: The primary focus of my work revolved around developing features\nfor consult helper that assists doctors in their consultation with their patients. Apart from the\nEMR work, front-end development tasks pertaining to other projects were also completed.\n572\n\nMajor learning outcomes: The internship work focused on front-end web development work.\nThe most important learning point was understanding the way AJAX calls are used for API\nintegration in Laravel PHP framework. Apart from this, I also improved my understanding of the\nway HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together and integrate to give a working webpage. Last\nbut not the least, the internship really helped me improve my soft communication skills. Agile\ndevelopment cycle with Scrum methodology meant there were daily meetings of our team so we\ncould know how the work was progressing. Active as well as passive participation skills were\ngreatly enhanced. I got to know the entire process of making a product, from the conception to\nthe execution.\nDetails of papers / patents: No papers or patents were developed in this internship.\nBrief description of working environment, expectations from the company: As a front-end\nweb developer, one will be part of a team, which in itself has people from the back-end, front-\nend, app developers, web developers and QA people. Agile development cycle with Scrum\nmethodology is followed which means development cycles usually last for 2-3 weeks, within\nwhich each team member is expected to deliver on their commitments. Before each sprint cycle\nstarts, teams meet to plan everything, list the story points and then fill in the commitment chart,\nwhich is then followed for the entire sprint. During my internship, the interns had regular catchup\nmeets with the CTO and HR for addressing any issues. Apart from regular work, the HR team\norganized leisure activities from time to time. The overall working environment is very friendly,\nharbors a spirit of team-work due to the nature of work methodology, the authorities are easily\naccessible for any grievances and the atmosphere is conducive to great learning.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Data structures and algorithm, Object oriented\nprogramming, Database systems."

				"writeUp": "Student write-up\nShort summary of work done during PS-II: My PS2 at Thomson Reuters was at technology\nteam of TR finance, and my team had a mixture of engineers, MBA people, etc. who were\nworking on things like development, ML, analytics, and automation. As far as my work is\nconcerned, I did multiple projects, which majorly were in full-stack development and time-series\nforecasting using Machine learning. I also worked on quick automation-based projects as per\nthe requirement of the team. In the first project, my responsibility was to ideate and implement a\nfull-stack portal which was to be used for project tracking, storage of files and distribution to the\nclients under specified business constraints. I was given full freedom to plan the project and\ndecide on the tech-stack. I implemented the complete backend using Spring Boot (Java) and\nfrontend using Angular. Database chosen was MongoDB. In the other project, myself with my\nco-PS student were given the task to predict the future forecast of expenses for various\nbusiness   units   using   ML.   We   chose   SARIMAX   model   for   time-series   forecasting   and\nimplemented the complete business requirement logic around that using Python. We had to\ndynamically adjust as per business constraints and requirements. At the end, another ML based\nproject started but we were just helping hands in that due to time constraint. Apart from this, few\nautomation projects of manipulating excel, decoding encoded invoices, etc. was given for which\n578\n\nI was given the task to build automated workflows to get required output. I majorly used Python\nand associated libraries.\nTool used (Development tools - H/w, S/w): Development - Spring Boot, Java, Apache Maven,\nAngular, HTML, CSS, Typescript, MongoDB.\nMachine Learning - Python, Statsmodels, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit.\nAutomation - Python, Selenium, Pandas, Pywinauto, Pywin32, UIPath.\nObjectives of the project: 1. To ideate and implement a full-stack web portal to be used as\nproject tracker, storage and distribution hub for internal workings in TR 2. To ideate and\nimplement a time-series forecasting model to forecast monthly expenses in various business\nunits.\nMajor   learning   outcomes:   Time-series   forecasting,   full-stack   development,   end-to-end\ndevelopment project ideation and implementation, automation.\nDetails of papers / patents: None\nBrief   description   of   working   environment,   expectations   from   the   company:   The\nenvironment at TR is great, and everyone is supportive. One is given complete freedom to what\nhe / she wants to do to design solution approach for the given problem and implement it. I got a\nchance to interact and work with many cross-functional teams throughout my tenure, who\nworked at different places, like Bangalore, US, UK, under different domains, like accountancy,\nsales, technical, and people from upper management. The team is supportive of limitations and\npeople are willing to help. So, the exposure is great. The expectations that I experienced was\nthat I always had the option to specify my own deadlines, but it is expected of me to not exceed\nit. Working hours are friendly and there is always a flexibility to adjust it as per your need if one\ncan meet their commitment. However, one is expected to be available for all discussions and\nmeetings, whenever they are scheduled to be. But majority of the projects in the team are\nautomation based and so if someone wants to do different things (like development, ML), they\nhave to make efforts to get such a project in the bag and commit to deliver it. One is also\nexpected to self-learn and apply. Apart from automation, as the team is getting new into ML and\ndevelopment, there will not be much technical help around. All in all, I would summarize by\n579\n\nsaying that it is good option to have if someone is looking for just a good overall internship\nexperience only.\nAcademic courses relevant to the project: Object oriented programming, Neural networks\nand Fuzzy logic, Machine learning, Database systems."
